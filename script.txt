               EXT. CALIFORNIA DESERT - DAY

               We float up a steep scrubby slope. We hear male voices gently
               singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable, Western
               accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:

                                   THE STRANGER
                         A way out west there was this
                         fella, fella I want to tell you
                         about, fella by the name of Jeff
                         Lebowski. At least, that was the
                         handle his lovin' parents gave him,
                         but he never had much use for it
                         himself. This Lebowski, he called
                         himself the Dude. Now, Dude, that's
                         a name no one would self-apply
                         where I come from. But then, there
                         was a lot about the Dude that
                         didn't make a whole lot of sense to
                         me. And a lot about where he lived,
                         like- wise. But then again, maybe
                         that's why I found the place
                         s'durned innarestin'.

               We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at
               twilight stretches out before us.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         They call Los Angeles the City of
                         Angels. I didn't find it to be that
                         exactly, but I'll allow as there
                         are some nice folks there. 'Course,
                         I can't say I seen London, and I
                         never been to France, and I ain't
                         never seen no queen in her damn
                         undies as the fella says. But I'll
                         tell you what, after seeing Los
                         Angeles and thisahere story I'm
                         about to unfold-- wal, I guess I
                         seen somethin' ever' bit as
                         stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a
                         those other places, and in English
                         too, so I can die with a smile on
                         my face without feelin' like the
                         good Lord gypped me.

               INT. RALPH'S - NIGHT

               It is late, the supermarket all but deserted. We track in on
               a forty-ish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy
               case. He is THE DUDE. His rumpled look and relaxed manner
               suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.

               He feels quarts of milk for coldness and examines their
               expiration dates.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         Now this story I'm about to unfold
                         took place back in the early
                         nineties-- just about the time of
                         our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye
                         rackies. I only mention it 'cause
                         some- times there's a man-- I won't
                         say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee
                         ro?--but sometimes there's a man
                         ... and I'm talkin' about the Dude
                         here-- sometimes there's a man,
                         wal, he's the man for his time'n
                         place, he fits right in there-- and
                         that's the Dude, in Los Angeles...
                         and even if he's a lazy man, and
                         the Dude was certainly that--quite
                         possibly the laziest in Los Angeles
                         County.

               The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of
               milk. He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         ...which would place him high in
                         the runnin' for laziest worldwide-
                         but sometimes there's a man...
                         sometimes there's a man.

               CHECKOUT GIRL -

               She waits, arms folded.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         Wal...

               The Dude, scribbles something at the little customer's
               lectern.

               Milk beads his mustache.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         Lost my train of thought here.
                         But...

               The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and
               makes out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         Aw hell, I done innerduced him
                         enough.

               The Dude, peeks over his shades at a small black-and white TV
               next to the register shows George Bush on the White House
               lawn with helicopter rotors spinning behind him.

                                   GEORGE BUSH
                         --- call for a collective action.
                         This will not stand. This will not
                         stand! This aggression against, uh,
                         Kuwait.

               EXT. DUDE'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

               The Dude goes up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow
               court. He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small
               leatherette satchel in the other. He awkwardly hugs the
               grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.

               INT. DUDE'S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS

               The Dude enters and flicks on a light. His head is grabbed
               from behind and tucked into an armpit. We track with him as
               he is rushed through the living room, his arm holding the
               satchel flailing away from his body.

               Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece
               of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a
               hole.

               The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small
               bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of
               doorframe. His head is plunged into the toilet. The paper bag
               hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet rim
               and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the floor.

               The Dude blows bubbles.

               Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and
               gasps for air.

                                   BLOND MAN
                         Where's the money, Lebowski!

               His head is plunged back into the toilet.

                                   BLOND MAN (CONT'D)
                         We want that money, Lebowski. Bunny
                         said you were good for it.

               Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet again.

                                   BLOND MAN (CONT'D)
                         Where's the money, Lebowski!

               His head is plunged back into the toilet.

                                   BLOND MAN (CONT'D)
                         Where's the money, Lebowski!

               The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.

                                   BLOND MAN (CONT'D)
                         WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY,
                         SHITHEAD!

                                   DUDE
                         It's uh, it's down there somewhere.
                         Lemme take another look.

               His head is plunged back in.

                                   BLOND MAN
                         Don't fuck with us.

               The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and
               flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against the
               toilet.

                                   BLOND MAN (CONT'D)
                         Your wife owes money to Jackie
                         Treehorn, that means you owe money
                         to Jackie Treehorn.

               Looming over him is a strapping BLOND MAN.

               Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly
               and walks over to a rug.

                                   WOO
                         Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

               He starts peeing on the rug.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, no. Don't do that. Not on the
                         rug, man.

                                   BLOND MAN
                         See, You see what happens,
                         Lebowski? You see what happens?

                                   DUDE
                         Nobody calls me Lebowski. You got
                         the wrong guy. I'm the Dude, man.

                                   BLOND MAN
                         Your name is Lebowski, Lebowski.
                         Your wife is Bunny.

                                   DUDE
                         Muh muh Wi-- my wife? Bunny?

               He holds up his hand.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         You see a wedding ring on my
                         finger? Does this place look like
                         I'm fucking married? The toilet
                         seat's up man!

               The Blond Man stoops to unzip the satchel. He pulls out a
               bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious
               native.

               The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand. The Dude's
               hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his Sunglasses and
               puts on his dripping sunglasses.

                                   BLOND MAN
                         What the fuck is this?

                                   DUDE
                         Obviously you're not a golfer.

               The Blond Man drops the ball which pulverizes the tile.

                                   BLOND MAN
                         Woo?

               The Chinese man, WOO, zips his fly.

                                   WOO
                         Yeah?

                                   BLOND MAN
                         Isn't this guy supposed to be a
                         millionaire?

               They both look around.

                                   WOO
                         Fuck.

                                   BLOND MAN
                         Yeah, what do you think?

                                   WOO
                         He looks like a fuckin' loser.

               The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger
               and peeks over them.

                                   DUDE
                         Hey. At least I'm housebroken.

               The two men look at each other. They turn to leave.

                                   WOO
                         Fuckin' time waste.

               The Blond Man turns testily at the door.

                                   BLOND MAN
                         Thanks a lot, asshole.

               ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:

               BOWLING PINS -

               Scattered by a strike.

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY

               Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins
               flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes,
               sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a
               ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.

               The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a
               distant jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.

               A man with black hair, wearing a bowling shirt turns from the
               strike to walk back to the bench.

                                   DONNY
                         Wahooo, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.
                         Mark it, Dude.

               We track in on the circular bench towards a big man nursing a
               large plastic cup of Beer. He has dark worried eyes and a
               goatee. Hairy legs emerge from his blue jean shorts.

               He also wears a khaki army surplus vest over a black shirt.

                                   WALTER
                         This was a valued rug.

               This is WALTER. He taps a cigarette as he addresses the Dude.

               The Dude digs in his bag to remove his bowling ball.

               Walter clears his throat.

               DONNY, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next
               Walter.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         This was, uh--

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah man, it really tied the room
                         together--

                                   WALTER
                         This was a valued, uh.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah...

                                   DONNY
                         What tied the room together, Dude?

                                   DUDE
                         My rug.

                                   WALTER
                         Were you listening to the story,
                         Donny?

                                   DONNY
                         What?

                                   DUDE
                         Walter..

                                   WALTER
                         Were you listening to the Dude's
                         story?

                                   DONNY
                         I was bowling--

                                   WALTER
                         So you have no frame of reference,
                         here Donny. You're like a child who
                         wanders in -

                         - in the middle of a movie and
                         wants to--

                                   DONNY
                         What the fuck is he talking about?

                         My rug.

                                   WALTER
                         Forget it, Donny. You're out of
                         your element.

                         Walter, this isn't a guy who built

                                   WALTER
                         DONNY YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!
                         Dude the Chinaman is not the issue
                         here.

                         So who, who--

                                   WALTER
                         Jeff Lebowski. The other Jeffrey
                         Lebowski. The millionaire.

                                   WALTER
                         Plus, he has the wealth, obviously,
                         and the resources, uh, so that
                         there is no reason, there's no
                         FUCKING reason, why his wife should
                         go out and owe money all over town,
                         and then they come and they pee on
                         your fucking rug! Am I wrong?

                                   DUDE

                         Okay then. uh,

               He elaborately clears his throat.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         That rug really tied the room
                         together, did it not?

                                   DUDE
                         Fuckin' A.

                                   DONNY
                         And this guy peed on it.

                         compensate me for the fucking rug.
                         His wife goes out and owes money

                         your fucking Rug.

               INT. LEBOWSKI MANOR - DAY

               CLOSE ON A PLAQUE -

               We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in
               silver to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs
               International, honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR.

               Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room
               with a BRANDT. We hear the two men talk:

                                   BRANDT
                         This is the study. As you can see
                         the various commendations, awards--

                                   DUDE
                         Jeffery Lebowski...

                                   BRANDT
                         --citations, honorary degrees, et
                         cetera.

                                   DUDE
                         Hmm, very impressive.

                                   BRANDT
                         Please, feel free to inspect them.

                                   DUDE
                         Hum? Oh, I'm not that-- really, uh.

                                   BRANDT
                         Oh, Please! Please!

               We pan the walls, looking at various citations and
               certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed off
               screen:

                                   BRANDT (CONT'D)
                         That's the key to the city of
                         Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski
                         received two years ago in
                         recognition of his various civic,
                         uh... Oh, That's a Los Angeles
                         Chamber of Commerce Business
                         Achiever award, which is given--oh
                         not necessarily given every year!

                                   DUDE
                         Hey, is this uh..?

                                   BRANDT
                         Given only when there's a worthy--

                                   DUDE
                         is this ...?

                                   BRANDT
                         --somebody--

                                   DUDE
                         Is this him with Nancy?

                                   BRANDT
                         Yes indeed, that is Mr. Lebowski
                         with the First Lady, yes. It was
                         taken when Mrs. Reagan--

                                   DUDE
                         That's uh, Lebowski on the left
                         there?

                                   BRANDT
                         Yeah. Of course, Mr. Lebowski on
                         the left...

                                   DUDE
                         So he's a crip...you know a, a...

                                   BRANDT
                         uh, ahmmm...

                                   DUDE
                         Handicapped, kinda guy?

                                   BRANDT
                         Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes. This
                         picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan
                         was first lady of the nation, yes,
                         yes? Not of California.

               The Dude points to Charlton Heston in a photo with Jeffery
               Lebowski.

                                   DUDE
                         Chuck.

                                   BRANDT
                         In fact he met privately with the
                         President, though unfortunately
                         there wasn't time for a photo
                         opportunity.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, Nancy's pretty good.

                                   BRANDT
                         Oh, Wonderful woman. We were very
                         happy to--

                                   DUDE
                         Uh...these are, uh?

                                   BRANDT
                         Uh those are Mr. Lebowski's
                         children, so to speak--

                                   DUDE
                         Different mothers, huh?

                                   BRANDT
                         No, they're not--

                                   DUDE
                         So, racially he's pretty cool--

                                   BRANDT
                         Aha ha ha uh, they're not literally
                         his children; they're the Little
                         Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner
                         city children of promise but
                         without the necessary means for a
                         necessary means, for a higher
                         education, so Mr. Lebowski has
                         committed to sending all of them to
                         college.

               The young man removes the Dude's finger from one of the
               plaques.

                                   BRANDT (CONT'D)
                         Excuse me. Thank you, thank you.

                                   DUDE
                         Far out. Think he's got room for
                         one more?

                                   BRANDT
                         One uh--oh! Heh-heh. You never went
                         to college.

               The Dude's finger goes back to the plaque.

                                   BRANDT (CONT'D)
                         Please, uh, don't touch that.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh yeah, yeah, no I did, but uh,
                         You know I spent most of my time
                         uh, occupying various,
                         administration buildings uh--

                                   BRANDT
                         Um Hmmm.

                                   DUDE
                         --smoking a lot of thai-stick,
                         breaking into the ROTC--

                                   BRANDT
                         Aha hahahahahaha Yes, --

                                   DUDE
                         --and bowling. I'll tell you the
                         truth, Brandt, I don't remember
                         most of it.

               Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed,
               Man of the Year, Time Magazine cover which in the lower right
               corner says, ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI ACHIEVER? Oddly, the Dude's,
               face is on it; we realize that the display is mirrored.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Hmmm.

               We hear the door open and the whine of a motor. The Dude,
               wears shorts and an open hooded sweat shirt, turns to look.

               So does BRANDT, the young man we've been listening to. He
               wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.
               Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized
               wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a
                         Lebowski, that's terrific, but I'm
                         very busy, as I can imagine you
                         are. What can I do for you sir?

               He wheels himself behind a desk. The Dude sits facing him as
               Brandt withdraws.

                                   DUDE
                         Uh, well sir, it's, uh, this rug I
                         have, it really tied the room
                         together-uh--

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         You told Brandt on the phone, he
                         told me. Where do I fit in?

                                   DUDE
                         Well, uh, they were--they were
                         looking for you, these two guys, uh
                         you know they--

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         I'll say it again, you told Brandt
                         on the phone. He told me. I know
                         what happened. Yes? Yes?

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, so you know they were trying to
                         piss on your rug?

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Did I urinate on your rug?

                                   DUDE
                         You mean, did you personally come
                         and pee on my rug?

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Hello! Do you speak English son?
                         Parla usted Inglese? I'll say it
                         again. Did I urinate on your rug?

                                   DUDE
                         No, like I said, Woo, peed on my
                         rug.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         I just want to understand this sir,
                         every time a rug is micturated upon
                         in this fair city, I have to
                         compensate the person?

                                   DUDE
                         Come on, man, I'm not trying to
                         scam anybody here, uh, you know,
                         I'm just--uh...

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         You're just looking for a handout
                         like every other--are you employed,
                         Mr. Lebowski?

                                   DUDE
                         Huh? wait wait, let me, let me
                         explain something to you. Uh, I am
                         not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr.
                         Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's
                         what you call me. You know, uh,
                         That, or uh, his Dudeness, or uh
                         Duder, or uh El Duderino, if, you
                         know, you're not into the whole
                         brevity thing--uh.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Are you employed, sir?

                                   DUDE
                         Employed? ah ha...

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         You don't go out looking for a job
                         dressed like that do ya? On a
                         weekday?

                                   DUDE
                         Is this a--what day is this?

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Well I do work sir, so if you don't
                         mind--

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, I do mind. The Dude minds.
                         This will not stand, ya know, this
                         aggression will not stand, man. I
                         mean, your wife owes money--

               The Big Lebowski slams his fist down on the desk.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         My wife, is not the issue here! I
                         hope that someday my wife will
                         learn to live on her allowance,
                         which is ample, but if she does
                         not, that is her problem, not mine,
                         just as your rug is your problem,
                         just asÉ

               The Dude puts on his sunglassesÉ

                                   LEBOWSKI (CONT'D)
                         Éevery bum's lot in life is his own
                         responsibility regardless of whom
                         he chooses to blame. I didn't blame
                         anyone for the loss of my legs,
                         some chinaman took them from me in
                         Korea but I went out and achieved
                         anyway. I cannot solve your
                         problems, sir, only you can.

                                   DUDE
                         Ah fuck it.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Oh, "Fuck it!" Yes, that's your
                         answer! That's your answer to
                         everything! Tattoo it on your
                         forehead!

               The Dude gets up out of the chair.

                                   LEBOWSKI (CONT'D)
                         Your "revolution" is over, Mr.
                         Lebowski! Condolences! The bums
                         lost!

               The Dude heads for the door. Then opens the door.

                                   LEBOWSKI (CONT'D)
                         My advice to you is, to do what
                         your parents did! Get a job, sir!
                         The bums will always lose-- do you
                         hear me, Lebowski?

               The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing--

                                   LEBOWSKI (CONT'D)
                             (muffled)
                         ...THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS LOSE!

               HALLWAY -

               in a high coffered hallway. Brandt approaches.

                                   BRANDT
                         How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?

                                   DUDE
                         Okay. The old man told me to take
                         any rug in the house.

               EXT. WALKWAY - DAY

               A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down
               a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a
               swimming pool with Brandt and the Dude in front of him.

                                   BRANDT
                         Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see
                         you again some time, Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah sure, uh,

               DUDE'S POINT OF VIEW -

               Tracks toward the pool. A young woman sits facing it, her
               back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         ...if I'm in the neighborhood, you
                         know, and uh, I need to use the
                         john.

               CLOSER TRACK -

               Arc around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the
               nails emerald green.

               THE DUDE -

               Looking.

               WIDER -

               The young woman looks up at him. She is in her early
               twenties.

               She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude.

                                   BUNNY
                         Blow on them.

               The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over
               them.

                                   DUDE
                         Huh?

               She waggles her foot and giggles.

                                   BUNNY
                         G'ahead. Blow.

               The Dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot.

                                   DUDE
                         You want me to blow on your uh,
                         toes?

                                   BUNNY
                         Uh-huh, heh heh . . I can't blow
                         that far.

               The Dude looks over at the pool.

               A man in shorts floats in a dipped foam chair in the pool.

                                   DUDE
                         You sure he won't mind?

               The man bobbing in the foam chair is passed out. He

               is thin, in his thirties, with stringy blond hair. One arm
               trails off into the water; next to it, an empty whiskey
               bottle bobs.

                                   BUNNY
                         Uli doesn't care about anything.
                         He's a nihilist.

                                   DUDE
                         Ah, that must be exhausting.

                                   BUNNY
                         You're not blowing.

                                   BRANDT
                         Our guest has to be getting along,
                         Mrs. Lebowski.

                                   DUDE
                         Ahhh, you're Bunny.

                                   BUNNY
                         I'll suck your cock for a thousand
                         dollars.

               Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter:

                                   BRANDT
                         Ha-ha-ha-ha! Wonderful woman. We're
                         all very fond of her. Very free
                         spirited.

                                   BUNNY
                         Brandt can't watch though. Or he
                         has to pay a hundred.

                                   BRANDT
                         Aha-ha-ha-ha! That's marvelous.

               Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow.

               The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still
               looking at the young woman back over his shoulder.

                                   DUDE
                         Uhhhh...I'm just gonna go find a
                         cash machine.

               BOWLING PINS -

               Scattered by a strike.

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY

               The Bowlers: Donny backs away from the line, turns and walks
               back.

                                   DONNY
                         Wahooo...I'm slammin' 'em tonight
                         You guys are dead in the water!!

               As the Donny walks back to the scoring table he points to
               another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that
               shares the lane.

               Walter, just arriving, carries a leatherette satchel in one
               hand and a LARGE PLASTIC CARRIER in the other.

                                   WALTER
                         Alright! Way to go, Donny! If you
                         will it, it is no dream.

                                   DUDE
                         You're fucking twenty minutes late,
                         man. What the fuck is that?

                                   WALTER
                         Theodore Herzel.

                                   DUDE
                         Huh?

                                   WALTER
                         State of Israel. If you will it,
                         Dude, it is no dream.

                                   DUDE
                         What the fuck're you talking about
                         man? The carrier. What's in the
                         fucking carrier?

                                   WALTER
                         Huh? Oh!--Cynthia's dog. I think
                         it's a Pomeranian. I can't leave
                         him home alone or he eats the
                         furniture. I'm watching it while
                         Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in
                         Hawaii.

                                   DUDE
                         You brought a fucking Pomeranian
                         bowling?

                                   WALTER
                         What do you mean "brought it
                         bowling"? I didn't rent it shoes.
                         I'm not buying it a fucking beer.
                         He's not taking your fucking turn,
                         Dude.

               He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier. It scoots
               around the bowling table, sniffs at bowlers and wags its
               tail.

                                   DUDE
                         Man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me
                         to take care of her fucking dog
                         while she and her boyfriend went to
                         Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck
                         herself. Why can't she board it?

                                   WALTER
                         First of all, Dude, you don't have
                         an ex, secondly, this is a fucking
                         show dog with fucking papers. You
                         can't board it. It gets upset, its
                         hair falls out.

                                   DUDE
                         Hey man, Walter, you know--

                                   WALTER
                         Fucking dog has fucking papers-
                         Over the line!

               Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter.

                                   SMOKEY
                         Huh?

                                   WALTER
                         I'm sorry Smokey, You were over the
                         line, that's a foul.

                                   SMOKEY
                         Bullshit. Mark it eight Dude.

                                   WALTER
                         Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next
                         frame.

                                   SMOKEY
                         Bullshit. Walter! Mark it eight
                         Dude.

                                   WALTER
                         Smokey, this is not Nam. This is
                         bowling. There are rules.

                                   DUDE
                         Hey Walter come on, it's just--hey
                         man it's Smokey. So his toe slipped
                         over a little, you know, it's just
                         a game, man.

                                   WALTER
                         This is a league game. This
                         determines who enters the next
                         round-robin, am I wrong?

                                   SMOKEY
                         Yeah, but I wasn't--

                                   WALTER
                         Am I wrong!?

                                   SMOKEY
                         Yeah, but I wasn't over. Gimme the
                         marker, Dude, I'm marking it an
                         eight.

               Walter takes out a GUN.

                                   WALTER
                         Smokey my friend, you're entering a
                         world of pain.

                                   DUDE
                         Walter--man--

                                   WALTER
                         You mark that frame an eight,
                         you're entering a world of pain.

                                   SMOKEY
                         I'm not--

                                   WALTER
                         A world of pain.

                                   SMOKEY
                         Look Dude, I ... this is your
                         partner--

                                   WALTER
                         HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY? AM
                         I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A
                         SHIT ABOUT THE RULES? MARK IT ZERO!

               The Pomeranian excitedly yaps at Walter's knee, makes high
               body-twisting tail-wagging leaps.

                                   DUDE
                         They're calling the cops, man, put
                         the piece away.

               Walter points it at Smokey's head.

                                   WALTER
                         MARK IT ZERO!

                                   DUDE
                         Walter put the piece away.

                                   SMOKEY
                         Walter--

                                   WALTER
                         YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?

               Walter primes the gun.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         MARK IT ZERO!!

                                   SMOKEY
                         All right!! It's fucking zero! You
                         happy, you crazy fuck?

                                   WALTER
                         It's a league game, Smokey!

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car. The 'Pomeranian'
               trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier.

                                   DUDE
                         You can't do that man. These guys,
                         you know, they're like me, they're
                         pacificists. Smokey was a
                         conscientious objector.

                                   WALTER
                         You know Dude, I myself dabbled
                         with pacifism at one point. Not in
                         Nam, of course--

                                   DUDE
                         And you know he's got emotional
                         problems man!

                                   WALTER
                         You mean--beyond pacifism?

                                   DUDE
                         He's fragile, very fragile!

               As the two men get into the car:

                                   WALTER
                         Huh. I did not know that. Well,
                         it's all water under the bridge.
                         And we do enter the next round
                         robin, am I wrong?

                                   DUDE
                         No, you're not wrong--

                                   WALTER
                         Am I wrong!

                                   DUDE
                         You're not wrong, Walter, you're
                         just an asshole.

                                   WALTER
                         Okay then. We play Quintana and
                         O'Brien next week. They should be
                         pushovers.

               They watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot.

                                   DUDE
                         Man, willya just, just take it
                         easy, man.

                                   WALTER
                         You know, that's your answer for
                         everything, Dude. And let me point
                         out something--pacifism is not-
                         look at our current situation with
                         that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism
                         is not something to hide behind.

                                   DUDE
                         Just take it easy, man.

                                   WALTER
                         I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah? Wavin' the fuckin' gun
                         around?!

                                   WALTER
                             (smugly)
                         Calmer than you are.

               This irritates the Dude further.

                                   DUDE
                         Will you just take it easy?

               Walter is still smug.

                                   WALTER
                         Calmer than you are.

               INT. DUDE'S HOUSE

               A large, brilliant Persian rug lies in front of the Dude's
               beat-up old furniture.

               A beep.

                                   SMOKEY
                         Dude, this is Smokey. Look, I don't
                         wanna be a hard-on about this, and
                         I know it wasn't your fault, but I
                         just thought it was fair to tell
                         you that Gilbert and I will be
                         submitting this to the League and
                         asking them to set aside the round,
                         I don't know, or maybe, forfeit it
                         to us-- so, like I say, just
                         thought, you know, fair warning.
                         Tell Walter. I'm sorry.

               Beep.

               At the bar next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing
               kahlua, vodka and milk.

                                   BRANDT
                         Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at,
                         uh, well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.
                         Please call us as soon as is
                         convenient.

               Beep.

                                   BELL SALNICKER (CONT'D)
                         Mr. Lebowski, this is Bell
                         Salnicker with the Southern Cal
                         Bowling League, and I just got a,
                         an informal report, that a member
                         of your team, uh, Walter Sobchak,
                         drew a firearm during league play.
                         If this is true of course, it
                         contraviens a number of the
                         league's by-laws, and article 27 of
                         the league...

               We hear a knock at the door.

               THE DOOR - 

               It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding
               middle-aged man in a blue T-shirt and beige shorts.

                                   MARTY
                         Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Hey Marty.

                                   MARTY
                         Dude, I, I finally, I got the uh,
                         venue I wanted. Uh, I'm Performing
                         my dance quintet--you know, my
                         cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain
                         Street Theatre on Tuesday night,
                         and well I'd love it if you came
                         and gave me notes.

               The Dude takes a swig of his drink.

                                   DUDE
                         I'll be there man.

                                   MARTY
                         Uh, Dude, uh, tomorrow's already
                         the tenth.

                                   DUDE
                         Far out. Oh, oh, alright, okay.

                                   MARTY
                         Just, uh, just slip the rent under
                         my door.

               BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM -

               The voice continues on the machine.

                         Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again. Please
                         do call us as soon as you get in
                         and I'll send the limo. I hope
                         you're not avoiding this call
                         because of the rug, ha ha, which, I
                         assure you, is not a problem.
                         We need your help and, uh--well we
                         would very much like to see you.
                         Thank you. It's Brandt.

               INT. LEBOWSKI MANOR

               TRACKING -

               We push Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway.

               Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano. Brandt talks back over
               his shoulder:

                                   BRANDT
                         We've had some terrible news. Mr.
                         Lebowski is in seclusion in the
                         West Wing.

               Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors.

               Brandt announces ambiguously:

                                   BRANDT (CONT'D)
                         Mr. Lebowski.

               The music washes over us as we enter a great study where
               Jeffrey Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares
               hauntedly into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Funny-- I can look back on a life
                         of achievement, on challenges met,
                         competitors bested, obstacles
                         overcome. I've accomplished more
                         than most men, and without the use
                         of my legs. What. . . What makes a
                         man, Mr. Lebowski?

                                   DUDE
                         Dude.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Huh?

                                   DUDE
                         Uh, I, I don't know, sir.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Is it being prepared to do the
                         right thing? Whatever the cost?
                         Isn't that what makes a man?

                                   DUDE
                         Ummm..sure. That and a pair of
                         testicles.

               Lebowski is turned away from the Dude with a haunted stare,
               lost in thought.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         You're joking. But perhaps you're
                         right.

               The Dude pulls a 'Jay' out of his pants pocket.

                                   DUDE
                         You mind if I do a jay?

                         Bunny.

               The firelight shows teartracks on his cheeks.

                                   DUDE
                         'Scuse me?

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Bunny Lebowski... She is the light
                         of my life. Are you surprised at my
                         tears, sir?

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, fuckin' A.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Strong men also cry... Strong men
                         also cry.

               He clears his throat.

                         I received this fax this morning.

               Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and
               hands it to the Dude.

                                   LEBOWSKI (CONT'D)
                         As you can see, it is a ransom
                         note.

               The Dude examines the fax:

                         Huh?

                                   DUDE
                         This is a bummer man. That's a,
                         that's a bummer.

                         Brandt will fill you in on the
                         details.

               The Big Lebowski gazes into the fire.

               Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the
               hall.

               HALLWAY -

               The soprano's singing is once again faint. Brandt's voice is
               hushed:

                                   BRANDT
                         Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a
                         generous offer to you to act as
                         courier once we get instructions
                         for the money.

                                   DUDE
                         Why me, man?

                                   BRANDT
                         He believes that the culprits might
                         be the very people who, uh, soiled
                         your rug, and you're in a unique
                         position to confirm or, disconfirm
                         that suspicion.

                                   DUDE
                         He thinks the carpet-pissers did
                         this?

                                   BRANDT
                         Well Dude, we just don't know.

               BOWLING PINS

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY

               MUSIC: Spanish version of 'Hotel California' slow motion.

               WIDER -

               Still in slow motion. We are looking at a tall, thin,
               Hispanic bowler. He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester
               stretch, violet bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each
               side.

               He has a pink bowling ball which he holds in front of his
               face and he licks the ball. He lowers the ball on his back
               swing.

               Stitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his
               first name, "Jesus".

               He rolls the pink ball and slams the pins. He turns and to
               the music, does a bravado dance and a strut back to the seat
               taunting the competition.

                                   QUINTANA
                         Wheeling and thrusting a black
                         gloved single finger into the air.

               FAST TRACK IN -

               On the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic
               chairs. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler.

                                   DUDE
                         Fucking Quintana--that creep can
                         roll, man--

                                   WALTER
                         Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert,
                         Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah?

                                   WALTER
                         No. He's a sex offender. With a
                         record. He did six months in Chino
                         for exposing himself to an eight-
                         year-old.

               FLASHBACK -

               We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater,
               walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and ringing
               the bell.



                                   DUDE
                         Huh.

                                   WALTER
                         When he moved down to Hollywood he
                         had to go door-to-door to tell
                         everyone he was a pederast.

               The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man
               looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up.

                                   DONNY
                         What's a pederast, Walter?

                                   WALTER
                         Shut the fuck up, Donny.

               BACK TO WALTER AND THE DUDE -

                                   WALTER
                         So. How much they give you?

                                   DUDE
                         Twenty grand, man. And of course I
                         still keep the rug.

                                   WALTER
                         Just for making the hand-off?

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah.

               He slips a little black box out of his shorts pocket, and
               turns it on.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         ...They gave uh, Dude a beeper, so
                         whenever these guys call--

                                   WALTER
                         What if it's during a game?

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, I told him if it was during
                         league play--

               Donny has been watching Quintana.

                                   DONNY
                         What's during league play?

                                   DUDE
                         Uh, ya know...

                                   WALTER
                         Life does not stop and start at
                         your convenience --

                                   DUDE
                         I uh...

                                   WALTER
                         --you miserable piece of shit.

                                   DUDE
                         I, I figure uh,

                                   DONNY
                         What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

                                   DUDE
                         I figure it's easy money, ya know,
                         it's all pretty harmless. She
                         probably kidnapped herself.

                                   WALTER
                         Huh?

                                   DUDE
                         Aww...

                                   DONNY
                         What do you mean, Dude?

                                   DUDE
                         Rug-peers did not do this. Look at
                         it. Young trophy wife. Marries this
                         guy for money, she figures he isn't
                         giving her enough. Ya know, She
                         owes money all over town-- aww.

                                   WALTER
                         That...fucking...bitch!

                                   DUDE
                         It's all a goddamn fake man. It's
                         like Leninsaid, you look for the
                         person who will benefit. And uh,uh,
                         you know, uh...

                                   DONNY
                         I am the Walrus.

                                   DUDE
                         ...you know... you'll, uh, uh, you
                         know what I'm trying to say--

                                   DONNY
                         I am the Walrus.

                                   WALTER
                         That fucking bitch!

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah.

                                   DONNY
                         I am the Walrus.

                                   WALTER
                         That's ex-- Shut the fuck up,
                         Donny! V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich
                         Ulyanov!

                                   DONNY
                         What the fuck is he talking about?

                                   WALTER
                         Fucking exactly what happened.
                         Those--

               We see Quintana and his partner vigorously shining their
               bowling balls.

                                   DUDE
                         Hell yeah.

                                   WALTER
                         That makes me fucking SICK!

                                   DUDE
                         Well, what do you care, Walter?

                                   WALTER
                         Those rich fucks! This whole
                         fucking thing-- I did not watch my
                         buddies die face down in the muck
                         so that this fucking strumpet--

                                   DUDE
                         Walter--

                                   WALTER
                         This fuckin' whore...

                                   DUDE
                         I don't see any--

                                   WALTER
                         ...can waltz around town...

                                   DUDE
                         --connection with Vietnam, man.

                                   WALTER
                         Well, there isn't a literal
                         connection, Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Walter, face it, there isn't any
                         connection. Your roll.

                                   WALTER
                         Have it your way, but my point is--

                                   DUDE
                         Your roll--

                                   WALTER
                         My point is--

                                   DUDE
                         Your roll.

                                   QUINTANA
                         Are you ready to be fucked, man?

               They both look up.

               Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of
               the lanes. Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a
               windbreaker with a racing stripe and "Jesus" stitched on the
               breast. He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball
               satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein). Behind him stands his
               partner, Liam, a short fat Irishman with tufted brown hair.

                                   QUINTANA
                         I see you rolled your way into the
                         semis. Dios mio, man. Liam and me,
                         we're gonna fuck you up.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah well, ya know, that's just,
                         like uh, your opinion, man.

               Quintana looks at Walter.

                                   QUINTANA
                         Let me tell you something, pendejo.
                         You pull any your crazy shit with
                         us, you flash a piece out on the
                         lanes, I'll take it away from you
                         and stick it up your ass and pull
                         the fucking trigger till it goes
                         "click".

                                   DUDE
                         Jesus.

                                   QUINTANA
                         You said it, man. Nobody fucks with
                         the Jesus.

               Jesus walks away. Walter turns his head toward the Dude.

                                   WALTER
                         Eight-year-olds, Dude.

               INT. DUDE'S BUNGALOW

               We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug. His
               eyes are closed. He wears a Walkman headset. Leaking tinnily
               through the headphones we can just hear an intermittent
               clatter.

               On the rug lies a cassette case labeled --

               A: VENICE BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987. B: Bob

               The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a ball
               rumbling down the lane. On its impact with the pins, the Dude
               opens his eyes.

               A redhead woman looms over him. Next to her a young man in
               paint-spattered denims stoops and swings his fist at the
               Dude's head.

               The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends his head
               thunking back onto the rug.

               Fireworks explode against a field of black. We hear the "La
               la-la-la" of 'The Man in Me'.

               The black field dissolves into the pattern of the rug.

               The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of the city of
               Los Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed.

               The Dude flies over the city, his arms thrown out in front of
               him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his bowling
               shirt. He looks up.

               Ahead the mysterious redhead woman wings away, riding on the
               Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet. She is outpacing
               us, growing smaller.

               The Dude does a couple of lazy breast strokes and then
               notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward
               hand.

               His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic
               implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its
               weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He
               falls. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down toward
               the city, dragged by the ball.

               A reverse looking up shows the Dude hurtling toward us out of
               the inky sky, his eyes wide with horror. Led by the bowling
               ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in black.

               We hear a distant rumble, like thunder. Dull reflections
               materialize in the darkness. They are glints off the shiny
               surface of an oncoming bowling ball.

               We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of a
               ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being
               regurgitated up at us, overtaking us.

               The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass
               rolling a huge shadow across his face.

               The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward
               us --finger holes.

               The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing us
               once again in black..

               The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a
               bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in
               the thumbhole of the rolling ball.

               We see the receding bowler spinning away. It is the redhead
               woman, performing her follow-through.

               Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and
               away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor;
               ceiling; approaching pins; again and again.

               We hit the pins and clatter into blackness. We hear pins
               spin, hit each other and drop.

               We hear an irritating, insistent beeping along with the song
               'The Man in Me'.

                                                                FADE IN:

               We are close on the Dude, upside down. As the picture fades
               'The Man in Me' continues, but filtered and faint. They come
               from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is now askew,
               with one arm off his ear.

               As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put him
               right side around. His head is now resting against hardwood
               floor, not rug.

                                   DUDE
                         Aaaah...Oh man. Ohhhh...Awwww...

               He raises falls back to the bare floor.

               The rug is gone.

               The beeper on the zipper of his hooded sweat shirt blinks red
               in sync with the continuing irritating beeps.

               WIDE ON THE ROOM

               The beeps continue.

               INT. LEBOWSKI MANOR

               TRACK -

               We push Brandt down the familiar marble hallway.

               Again there is a distant aria. Brandt throws out a wrist to
               look at his watch.

                                   BRANDT
                         They called about eighty minutes
                         ago. They want you to take the
                         money and drive north on the 405.
                         They will call you on the portable
                         phone with instructions in about
                         forty minutes. One person only,
                         they were very clear on that, or
                         I'd go with you. One person only.
                         What happened to your jaw?

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, nothin', man just ah--

               They have reached the little desk outside of the Big
               Lebowski's office; Brandt opens the top cabinet with a key
               and takes out an attache case.

                                   BRANDT
                         Here's the money...

               He hands this to the Dude...

                                   BRANDT (CONT'D)
                         and the phone...

               ...along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying
               case.

                                   BRANDT (CONT'D)
                         Please, Dude, follow whatever
                         instructions they give.

                                   DUDE
                         Alright.

                                   BRANDT
                         Her life is in your hands.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, man, don't say that man.

                                   BRANDT
                         Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat
                         that: Her life is in your hands.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh shit, man.

                                   BRANDT
                         Her life is in your hands, Dude.
                         And report back to us as soon as
                         it's done.

               INT. DUDE'S CAR - NIGHT

               We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through
               the front windshield. The headlights play over Walter
               standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK
               SECURITY. He wears combat fatigues, and holds a battered
               brown briefcase. He also holds an irregular shape bundled in
               a news paper wrapping.

               The car stops in front of him

                                   DUDE
                         Where the fuck are you going, man?

                                   WALTER
                         Take the ringer. I'll drive.

               He opens the Dude's door and hands in the briefcase The Dude
               takes the briefcase and slides over.

                                   DUDE
                         The what?

                                   WALTER
                         The ringer! The ringer, Dude!

               The car drives off.

               The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it.

                                   DUDE
                         What the...

                                   WALTER
                         Have they called yet?

                                   DUDE
                         What the hell is this?

                                   WALTER
                         My dirty undies dude. Laundry,
                         The whites.

                                   DUDE
                         Walter, I'm sure there's a reason
                         you brought your dirty undies man.

               He closes the briefcase.

                                   WALTER
                         Thaaaat's right, Dude. The weight.
                         The ringer can't look empty.

                                   DUDE
                         Walter--what the fuck are you
                         thinking man?

                                   WALTER
                         Well you're right, Dude, I got to
                         thinking. I got to thinking why
                         should we settle for a measly
                         fucking twenty grand--

                                   DUDE
                         We? What the fuck we? You said you
                         just wanted to come along--

                                   WALTER
                         My point, Dude, is why should we
                         settle for twenty grand when we can
                         keep the entire million. Am I
                         wrong?

                                   DUDE
                         Yes you're wrong. This isn't a
                         fucking game man.

                                   WALTER
                         Oh, but it is a game. You said so
                         yourself. She kidnapped herself.

                                   DUDE
                         I said I thought--

               The phone chirps. Dude grabs it.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Dude here.

                                   ULI
                             (German accent)
                         Who is this?

                                   DUDE

                         us to go?

                                   ULI
                         Us?

                                   DUDE
                         Shit. . . yeah, you know, uh, me
                         and the driver. I'm not uh,
                         handling the money and driving the
                         car and talking on the phone all by
                         my fucking--

                                   ULI
                         Shut the fuck up.

               Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows:

                                   WALTER
                         Dude, are you fucking this up?

                                   ULI
                         Who is that?

                                   DUDE

                                   WALTER
                         What the fuck's going on?

                                   DUDE
                         Walter!

                                   WALTER
                         What the fuck is going on?

                                   DUDE
                         He hung up, man! You fucked it up!
                         You fucked it up! Her life was in
                         our hands man!

                                   WALTER
                         Easy, Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         We're screwed now! We don't get
                         shit, they're gonna kill her! We're
                         fucked, Walter!

                                   WALTER
                         Nothing is fucked Dude. Come on.
                         You're being very unDude. They'll
                         call back. Look, she kidnapped her--

               The phone chirps.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Ya see? Nothing's fucked here,
                         Dude. Nothing is fucked. They're a
                         bunch of fucking amateurs--

                                   DUDE
                         But Walter, Walter will you just
                         shut the fuck up! Don't say peep
                         when I'm doing business here man.

                                   WALTER
                             (patronizing)
                         Okay Dude. Have it your way.

               The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         But they're amateurs.

               The Dude glares at Walter. Into the phone:

                                   DUDE
                         Dude.

                                   ULI
                         Okay, vee proceed. But only if
                         there is no funny stuff.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, yeah.

                                   ULI
                         So no funny stuff. Okay?

                                   DUDE
                         Just tell me where the fuck you
                         want us to go.

               A HIGHWAY SIGN: SIMI VALLEY ROAD NEXT LEFT.

               It flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         That was the sign man.

               Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road.

                                   WALTER
                         So, all we gotta do is get her
                         back, no one's in a position to
                         complain, and we keep the
                         baksheesh.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, terrific, Walter. But you
                         haven't told me how we're gonna get
                         her back. Where is she?

                                   WALTER
                         That's the simple part, Dude. We
                         make the handoff, I grab one of 'em
                         and beat it out of him.

               He looks at the Dude.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         ...Huh?

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah. That's a great plan, Walter.
                         That's fucking ingenious, if I
                         understand it correctly. That's a
                         Swiss fucking watch.

                                   WALTER
                         Thaaat's right, Dude. The beauty of
                         this is its simplicity. Once a plan
                         gets too complex, everything can go
                         wrong. If there's one thing I
                         learned in Nam--

               The phone chirps.

                                   DUDE
                         Dude.

                                   WALTER
                         What'd he say? Where's the hand
                         off?

                                   DUDE
                         There is no fucking hand-off man.
                         At a wooden bridge we throw the
                         money out of the car!

                                   WALTER
                         Huh?

                         We throw the money out of the
                         moving car!

               Walter stares dumbly for a beat.

                                   WALTER
                         No, we can't do that, Dude. That
                         fucks up our plan.

                                   DUDE
                         Well call them up and explain it to
                         'em, Walter! Your plan is so
                         fucking simple, I'm sure they'll
                         fucking understand it! That's the
                         beauty of it!

                                   WALTER
                         Wooden bridge, huh?

                                   DUDE
                         I'm throwing the money, Walter!
                         We're not fucking around man!

                                   WALTER
                         Ok, dude the bridge is coming up!
                         Gimme the ringer, Chop-chop!

                                   DUDE
                         Fuck that! Walter I love you, but
                         sooner or later you're gonna have
                         to face the fact that you're a
                         goddamn moron.

                                   WALTER
                         Okay, Dude. No time to argue.

                                   DUDE
                         Hey man! hey--

                                   WALTER
                         Here's the bridge--

                                   DUDE
                         Walter! hey--hey walter hey--

               There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.

               The Dude is holding the money briefcase from the back seat.
               Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to grab the
               laundry.

                                   WALTER
                         There goes the ringer.

               He flings it out the window.

                                   DUDE
                         What the fuck!

                                   WALTER
                         Okay Dude, your wheel!

                                   DUDE
                         Walter Hey, Hey what the fuck?

                                   WALTER
                         At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!
                         I double back, grab one of 'em and
                         beat it out of him! The uzi!

                                   DUDE
                         Uzi?

               Walter grabs across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle.

                                   WALTER
                         You didn't think I was rolling out
                         of here naked did ya!

                                   DUDE
                         Walter, Walter what the--

               Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out
               over the road.

                                   WALTER
                         Fifteen! Dude This is it! Let's
                         take that hill!

                                   DUDE
                         Walter hey Walter--

               Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he
               hits the pavement. The car swerves and lurches and the Dude,
               cursing, takes the wheel.

               OUTSIDE -

               Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!-
               muzzle flashes tear open the wrapping paper.

               INSIDE THE CAR -

               The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel.

               OUTSIDE -

               The car clunks and screams around in a skid.

               INSIDE -

               The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something.

               OUTSIDE -

               As the Dude struggles up holding the satchel of money.

               There is a distant engine roar. A motorcycle bumps up onto
               the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires
               squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite
               direction. It is closely followed by two more roaring
               motorcycles.

                                   DUDE
                         Ah, ahhhh...

               The front of his car is crumpled into a pole. The car body
               saps back to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot
               out.

               WALTER is just rising from the ground massaging an injured
               knee.

               The Dude runs up the road toward the bridge, frantically
               waving the satchel in the air.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         WE HAVE IT! WE HAVE IT!! WE HAVE
                         IT!... WE...have it.

               The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching
               the three red tail lights fishtail away.

               AFTER A LONG STARING SILENCE:

                                   WALTER
                         Ahh fuck it dude, let's go bowling.

               WALTER -

               Stands at the end of the lane with a cigarette in his mouth
               and holding a bowling ball up in front of him. Slowly he
               walks to the line and rolls.

               He returns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the molded
               plastic chairs. The Dude listlessly holds the portable phone
               in his lap. It is ringing.

                                   WALTER
                         Aitz chaim he, Dude. As the ex used
                         to say.

                                   DUDE
                         What the fuck is that supposed to
                         mean? What the fuck're we gonna
                         tell Lebowski?

                                   WALTER
                         Huh? Oh, him, uh, I don't kn.. um--
                         what exactly is the problem?

                                   DUDE
                         Ah, the problem is--what do you
                         mean what's the--

               The portable phone stops ringing.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         There was no--we didn't uh--
                         they're gonna kill that poor woman
                         man.

                                   WALTER
                         What the fuck're you talking about?
                         That poor woman--that poor slut--
                         kidnapped herself, Com'on Dude. You
                         said so yourself.

                                   DUDE
                         Man! I said I thought she kidnapped
                         herself! You're the one who's so
                         fucking certain--

                                   WALTER
                         That's right, Dude, 100% certain--

               Donny trots excitedly up.

                                   DONNY
                         They posted the next round of the
                         tournament--

                                   WALTER
                         Donny, shut the fu--when do we

                         reschedule.

                         Walter, what'm I gonna tell
                         Lebowski?

                                   WALTER

                         office-- who's in charge of

                                   DUDE
                         Walter--

                                   DONNY
                         Burkhalter.

                                   WALTER

                         thousand times I DON'T ROLL ON

                                   DUDE
                         Walter--

                                   DONNY
                         He already posted it.

                                   WALTER
                         WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!

                                   DUDE
                         WHO GIVES A SHIT! Uh, they're gonna
                         kill that poor woman, man. What am
                         I gonna tell Lebowski?

                                   WALTER
                         C'mon Dude, uh, eventually she'll
                         get sick of her little game and,
                         you know, wander on back--

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah uh...

                                   DONNY
                         How come you don't roll on
                         Saturday, Walter?

                                   WALTER
                         I'm shomer shabbos.

                                   DONNY
                         What's that, Walter?

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, and in the meantime, what do
                         I tell Lebowski?

                                   WALTER
                         Saturday, Donny, is shabbos. The
                         Jewish day of rest. That means I
                         don't work, I um, don't drive a
                         car, I don't fucking ride in a car,
                         I don't handle money, I don't turn
                         on the oven, and I sure as shit
                         DON'T FUCKING ROLL!

                                   DONNY
                         Sheesh.

                                   WALTER
                         SHOMER SHABBAS!

                                   DUDE
                         Walter, how am I going to--hows--

                                   WALTER
                         Shomer fucking shabbas!

               The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh fuck, that, that's it. I'm out
                         of here.

                                   WALTER
                         Aw come on Dude.

               Walter looks at Donny and silently mouths the words, 'What a
               fucking baby'.

               Walter stumbles up and he and Donny join the Dude as he walks
               out of the bowling alley. He rubs his leg that he hurt
               falling out of the car.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Dude! Dude! ... ow, fuck, you just
                         tell him, uh tell him we made the
                         drop and everything went, uh you
                         know--

                                   DONNY
                         Oh yeah, how'd it go?

                                   WALTER
                         Went alright. Dude's car got a
                         little dinged up--

                                   DUDE
                         Walter, we didn't make the fucking
                         hand-off man! They didn't get, the
                         fucking money and they're gonna--
                         they're gonna--

                                   WALTER
                         "They're gonna kill that poor
                         woman."

               He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         They're gonna kill that poor woman.

                                   DONNY
                         Hey Walter, if you can't ride in a
                         car, how d'you get around on
                         Shammas--

                                   WALTER
                         Really, Dude, you surprise me.
                         They're not gonna kill shit.
                         They're not gonna do shit. What can
                         they do? They're a bunch of fuckin'
                         amateurs. And meanwhile, look at
                         the bottom line. Who's sitting on a
                         million fucking dollars? Am I
                         wrong?

                                   DUDE
                         Walter--

                                   WALTER
                         Who's got a fucking million fucking
                         dollars sittin' in the trunk of our
                         car?

                                   DUDE
                         "Our" car, Walter?

                                   WALTER
                         And what do they got? My dirty
                         undies. My fucking whites---Say,
                         Dude, where is your car?

               The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out
               at an empty parking space.

                                   DONNY
                         Who's got your undies, Walter?

                                   WALTER
                         Where's your car, Dude?

                                   DUDE
                         You don't know, Walter?

                                   WALTER
                         Hmm. It was parked in a handicapped
                         zone. Perhaps they towed it.

                                   DUDE
                         You fucking know it's been stolen!

                                   WALTER
                         Well, certainly that's a
                         possibility, Dude--

                                   DUDE
                         Aw, fuck it.

               The Dude walks away across the lot. The portable phone starts
               ringing again.

                                   DONNY
                         Where you going, Dude?

                                   DUDE
                         I'm goin' home, Donny.

                                   DONNY
                         Your phone's ringing, Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Thank you, Donny.

               INT. DUDE'S LIVING ROOM

               The Dude is sitting forward in his easy chair.

               Facing him on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one
               middle-aged, the other a fresh-faced rookie.

               The portable phone in the Dude's lap chirps.

               The Dude waits for the rings to end. When they do:

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Uh, yeah, uh, green. Some uh,
                         brown, uh or, rust, coloration.

                                   YOUNGER COP
                         And was there anything of value in
                         the car?

                                   DUDE
                             (dully)
                         Oh uh, yeah. Uh, a tape deck. Some
                         Creedence tapes. And there was a,
                         uh. . .uh my briefcase.

                                   YOUNGER COP
                         In the briefcase?

                                   DUDE
                         Uh, uh Papers. Ya know, just
                         papers. Uh you know, my papers.
                         Business papers.

               The Dude reacts to the question by pushing back into the
               chair.

                                   YOUNGER COP
                         And what do you do, sir?

                                   DUDE
                         I'm unemployed.

               The home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct from the chirp
               of the portable. The Dude makes no move to answer it.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         My rug was also stolen.

                                   YOUNGER COP
                         Your rug was in the car.

               The Dude waves his hand over the floor.

                                   DUDE
                         No. Here.

                                   YOUNGER COP
                         Separate incidents?

               The Dude looks over at the phone.

               Silence.

               Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks on.

               Dude's Voice on Machine, 'The Dude's not in. Leave a message
               after the beep. It takes a minute.'

                                   DUDE
                         You find them much? Uh these stolen
                         cars?

                                   YOUNGER COP
                         Sometimes. I wouldn't hold out much
                         hope for the tape deck though.

                         Or the Creedence.

                                   DUDE
                         Well what about uhhhhhh, the
                         briefcase?

               Beep.

                                   MAUDE
                         Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.
                         Call when you get home and I'll
                         send a car for you. My name is
                         Maude Lebowski. I'm the one who
                         took your rug.

                                   YOUNGER COP
                         Well, I guess we can close the file
                         on that one.

               INT. MAUDE'S LOFT

               TRACKING FORWARD -

               We are moving through the open living area of a large
               downtown L.A. loft. A huge unfinished canvas, lit by standing
               industrial lights, dominates the floor. The furnishings are
               spare given the space.

               We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball. The Dude,
               standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky
               depths of the cavernous space.

               Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head.

               As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass.

               We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended
               from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the
               floor. She holds a paint brushes in both hands with which she
               flicks paint down at the canvas.

               Two young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and
               sneakers reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of
               its track and slowly lower the woman to the floor.

                                   MAUDE
                         Elfranco. Ajuda me abajo. I'll be
                         with you in a moment, Mr. Lebowski.

               The two men help Maude out of her sling. She is naked except
               for leather harness straps which ring her breasts and wrap
               her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix look.

                                   MAUDE
                         Does the female form make you
                         uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski?

                                   DUDE
                         Uh, is that what this is a picture
                         of?

                                   MAUDE
                         In a sense, yes. My art has been
                         commended as being strongly
                         vaginal. Which bothers some men.
                         The word itself makes some men
                         uncomfortable. Vagina.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh yeah?

                                   MAUDE
                         Yes, they don't like hearing it and
                         find it difficult to say. Whereas
                         without batting an eye a man will
                         refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or
                         his "Johnson".

                                   DUDE
                         "Johnson"?

                                   MAUDE
                         All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get
                         down to cases. My father told me
                         he's agreed to let you have the
                         rug, but it was a gift from me to
                         my late mother, and so was not his
                         to give. Now.

               She hands the dude a cloth.

                                   MAUDE (CONT'D)
                         Your face... As for this
                         "kidnapping"--

                                   DUDE
                         Huh?

                                   MAUDE
                         Yes, I know about it. And I know
                         that you acted as courier. And let
                         me tell you something: the whole
                         thing stinks to high heaven.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, right, but, but let me
                         explain something about that rug--

                                   MAUDE
                         Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

                                   DUDE
                         Excuse me?

                                   MAUDE
                         Sex. The physical act of love.
                         Coitus. Do you like it?

                                   DUDE
                         I was talking about my rug.

                                   MAUDE
                         You're not interested in sex?

                                   DUDE
                         You mean coitus?

                                   MAUDE
                         I like it too. It's a male myth
                         about feminists that we hate sex.
                         It can be a natural, zesty
                         enterprise. However there are some
                         people--it is called satyriasis in
                         men, nymphomania in women--who
                         engage in it compulsively and
                         without joy.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, no.

                                   MAUDE
                         Oh yes Mr. Lebowski, these
                         unfortunate souls cannot love in
                         the true sense of the word. Our
                         mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of
                         these.

                                   DUDE
                         Listen, Maude uh, I'm sorry if your
                         stepmother is a nympho, but uh, I
                         don't see what this has to do with
                         uh--do you have any Kahlua?

                                   MAUDE
                         Take a look at this, sir.

                                   DUDE
                         Hmm?

               She aims a remote at a projection TV. The screen flickers to
               life. A title card:

               JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS

               Uli is driving a car.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Oh, I know that guy. He's a
                         nihilist.

               SECOND CARD:

               KARL HUNGUS

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Karl Hungus.

               A THIRD CARD:

               BUNNY LAJOYA

               A FOURTH CARD:

               LOGJAMMIN'

               The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of Kahlua frozen halfway to
               his glass.

               From the television set we hear a doorbell ring, and then a
               door opening.

               On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced man
               in White cover-alls. It is Uli, the floater in Lebowski's
               pool. The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski.

                                   BUNNY
                         Hi.

                                   ULI
                         Hello. Mein dizbatcher says zere

                                   BUNNY
                         Yeah, come on in, I'm not really
                         sure exactly what's really wrong
                         with the cable.

                                   ULI
                         Dat's vhy day zent me, I'm un
                         exspert.

                                   BUNNY
                         The TV's in here.

                                   MAUDE
                         You recognize her, of course.

                                   ULI
                         Helga, bring mein toolz.

               From off camera a voice says, a faint "Okay"

                                   BUNNY
                         Oh, that's my friend Shari. She
                         just came over to use the shower.

                                   MAUDE
                             (grimly)
                         The story is ludicrous.

                                   ULI
                         Mein nommen ist Karl. ich bin
                         expert.

                                   SHARI
                         You must be here to fix the cable.

                                   MAUDE
                         Good lord. You can imagine where it
                         goes from here.

                                   DUDE
                         He fixes the cable?

                                   MAUDE
                         Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

               Maude switches off the set.

                                   MAUDE (CONT'D)
                         Little matter to me that this woman
                         chose to pursue a career in
                         pornography, nor that she has been
                         "banging" Jackie Treehorn, to use
                         the parlance of our times. However.
                         I am one of two trustees of the
                         Lebowski Foundation, the other
                         being my father. The Foundation
                         takes youngsters from Watts and--

                                   DUDE
                         Shit yeah, the Achievers.

                                   MAUDE
                         Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,
                         yes, and proud we are of all of
                         them. I asked my father about his
                         withdrawal of a million dollars
                         from the Foundation account and he
                         told me about this "abduction", but
                         I tell you it is preposterous. This
                         compulsive fornicator is taking my
                         father for the proverbial ride.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, but my-

                                   MAUDE
                         I'm getting to your rug. My father
                         and I don't get along; he doesn't
                         approve of my lifestyle and,
                         needless to say, I don't approve of
                         his. However, I hardly wish to make
                         my father's embezzlement a police
                         matter, so I'm proposing that you
                         try to recover the money from the
                         people you delivered it to.

                                   DUDE
                         Well-- I could do that--

                                   MAUDE
                         If you successfully do so, I will
                         compensate you to the tune of 10%
                         of the recovered sum.

                                   DUDE
                         A hundred.

                                   MAUDE
                         Thousand, yes, bones or clams or
                         whatever you call them.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah ah, but, but what about my uh--

                                   MAUDE
                         --your rug, yes, well with that
                         money you can buy any number of
                         rugs that don't have sentimental
                         value for me. And I am sorry about
                         that crack on the jaw.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh that's that's fine. It doesn't
                         even uh--

                                   MAUDE
                         Here's the name and number of a
                         doctor who will look at it for you.
                         You will receive no bill. He's a
                         good man, and thorough.

                                   DUDE
                         Tha, tha, That's thoughtful but--

                                   MAUDE
                         Please see him, Jeffrey. He's a
                         good man, and thorough.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, uh... all right.

               INT. LIMO

               The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian, listening to
               the chauffeur, a man of about the same age.

                                   TONY
                         --So he says, "My wife's a pain in
                         the ass. She's always tryin' to
                         bust my friggin aggets, my
                         daughter's married to a Jadrool
                         loser bastard, I got a rash so bad
                         on my ass I can't even siddown. But
                         you know me. I can't complain."

               THROUGH RASPING LAUGHTER:

                                   DUDE
                         Fuckin' A, man. I got a rash man.
                         Fuckin' A...

               He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves
               milk on his mustache.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         ...I gotta tell ya Ton' man,
                         earlier in the day, I was feeling
                         really shitty man. Really down in
                         the dumps. Lost a little money...

                                   TONY
                         Heyh you know what? Forgeddaboutit
                         huh, forgedaboutit.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, fuck it man! I can't be
                         worried about that shit. Life goes
                         on man!

                                   TONY
                         Well home sweet home, Mr. L.

               The limo has rolled to a stop. The Dude gets out, still
               holding his drink.

                                   TONY (CONT'D)
                         Hey yo, com'eer. Who's your friend
                         in the Volkswagon?

               Tony jerks a thumb over his shoulder.

                                   DUDE
                         Huh?

               The Dude turns to look.

               HIS POV -

               Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the
               curb. In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape.

                                   TONY
                         Yeah, he followed us here.

               The Dude scowls.

                                   DUDE
                         When did he start fol-- whoaaaa-
                         what the fuck!

               The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half
               nelson by another uniformed chauffeur.

                                   SECOND CHAUFFEUR
                         Into the limo, you sonofabitch. No
                         arguments.

               As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds his
               drink away from his chest and up out of the way.

                                   DUDE
                         Hey, hey, hey careful, man! There's
                         a beverage here!

               The waiting limo's back door is flung open.

               INSIDE -

               The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly and he lands on his side
               in a seat facing the front. The door is slammed behind him.

               His drink is still intact.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Start talking and talk fast you
                         lousy bum!

                                   BRANDT
                         We've been frantically trying to
                         reach you, Dude.

               Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from
               the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!

                                   DUDE
                         Well, well we--I, I, I don't--

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         They did not receive the money, you
                         nitwit! They did not receive the
                         money! HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!

                                   BRANDT
                         This is our concern, Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         No, man, nothing is fucked here--

                                   DUDE

                         THE GODDAMN PLANE HAS CRASHED INTO
                         THE MOUNTAIN!

                                   DUDE
                         Well man, come on, who're you gonna
                         believe? Those guys or uh--we
                         dropped off the damn money--

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         WE?!

                                   DUDE
                         I--the royal we, you know, the
                         editorial--I dropped off the money,
                         exactly as per--Look, man I've got
                         certain information alright?
                         Certain things have come to light,
                         and uh, ya know, has it ever
                         occurred to you, that uh, instead
                         of uh, you know running around, uh
                         uh, blaming me, given the nature of
                         all this new shit, you know it, it
                         it, this could be a uh, a lot more
                         uh, uh, uh, uh, complex, I mean
                         it's not just, it might not be,
                         just such a simple, uh--you know?

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         What in God's holy name are you
                         blathering about?

                                   DUDE
                         Well I'll tell you what I'm
                         blathering about! I got information
                         man--new shit has come to light and
                         and--shit, man! She kidnapped
                         herself!

               Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck. The Dude is encouraged.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Well sure man, look at it! Ya know.
                         A young trophy wife, in the
                         parlance of our times, ya know. She
                         uh, uh, owes money all over town,
                         including to known pornographers-
                         ha, and that's cool, that's that's
                         cool-- I- I'm saying, she needs
                         money man, and uh, you know, of
                         course they're gonna say they
                         didn't get it, uh uh, because she
                         wants more, man, she's gotta feed
                         the monkey, I- I mean--uh, hasn't
                         that ever occurred to you man? Sir?

                                   LEBOWSKI
                             (quietly)
                         No Mr. Lebowski, that had not
                         occurred to me.

                                   BRANDT
                         That had not occurred to us, Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Uh, okay, ya know, you guys aren't
                         privy to all the new shit, so uh,
                         you know, but hey, that's what you,
                         that's what you pay me for. Aha...
                         The Dude takes a hurried sip from
                         his drink. Um. Speaking of which,
                         do you think uh, that you could uh,
                         give me my twenty thousand in cash?
                         Uh, my concern is, and I've gotta
                         check with, with my accountant, but
                         that this might bump me up into a
                         higher tax uh--

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Brandt, give him the envelope.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh well, if you've already got the,
                         check made out, that that's cool.
                         Brandt is handing him a letter
                         sized envelope which is distended
                         by something inside.

                                   BRANDT
                         We received it this morning.

               The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton
               wadding and unrolls it.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Since you have failed to achieve,
                         even in the modest task that was
                         your charge, since you have stolen
                         my money, since you have
                         unrepentantly betrayed my trust. I
                         have no choice but to tell these
                         bums to do whatever is necessary to
                         recover their money from you,
                         Jeffrey Lebowski. And with Brandt
                         as my witness, I will tell you
                         this:

               The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped
               upinside. The Dude starts to unroll the inner package.

                                   LEBOWSKI (CONT'D)
                         Any further harm visited upon
                         Bunny, will be visited tenfold upon
                         your head.

               Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents
               of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish.

                                   LEBOWSKI (CONT'D)
                         ...My God sir. I will not abide
                         another toe.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

               The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off into
               space, both absently stirring their coffee with little
               clinking noises.

               AFTER A LONG BEAT:

                                   WALTER (LAUGHING)
                         That wasn't her toe dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Whose toe was it, Walter?

                                   WALTER
                         How the fuck should I know? I do
                         know that nothing about it
                         indicates--

                                   DUDE
                         The nail polish, Walter.

                                   WALTER
                         Fine, Dude. As if it's impossible
                         to get some nail polish, apply it
                         to someone else's toe--

                                   DUDE
                         Someone else's--where the fuck are
                         they gonna get--

                                   WALTER
                         You want a toe? I can get you a
                         toe, believe me. There are ways,
                         Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         But Walter--

                                   WALTER
                         You don't wanna know about it,
                         believe me.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, but Walter--

                                   WALTER
                         Hell I can get you a toe by 3
                         o'clock this afternoon--with nail
                         polish. These fucking amateurs.

                                   DUDE
                         Walter--

                                   WALTER
                         They send us a toe, we're supposed
                         to shit ourselves with fear. Jesus
                         Christ.

                                   DUDE
                         Walter--

                                   WALTER
                         The point is--

                                   DUDE
                         They're gonna kill her, Walter, and
                         then they're gonna kill me--

                                   WALTER
                         Dude that's, that's just the stress
                         talking, man. Now so far we have
                         what appears to me, to be a series
                         of victimless crimes--

                                   DUDE
                         What about the toe?

                                   WALTER
                         FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!

               A waitress enters.

                                   WAITRESS
                         Excuse me sir, could you please
                         keep your voices down, this is a
                         family restaurant.

                                   WALTER
                         Oh, please dear! For your
                         information: the Supreme Court has
                         roundly rejected prior restraint!

                                   DUDE
                         C'mon Walter, this is not a First
                         Amendment thing, man.

                                   WAITRESS
                         Sir, if you don't calm down I'm
                         going to have to ask you to leave.

                                   WALTER
                         Lady, I got buddies who died face-
                         down in the muck so that you and I
                         could enjoy this family restaurant!

               THE DUDE GETS UP:

                                   DUDE
                         All right, I'm out of here.

                                   WALTER
                         Hey Dude, don't go away man!
                         Com'on, this affects all of us man!

               The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him:

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Our basic freedoms!

               He looks defiantly around.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         I'm staying. I'm finishing my
                         coffee.

               He takes a drink of the coffee, then hits the counter lightly
               with his hands, and then he folds his arms on the counter,
               affecting nonchalance.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Enjoying my coffee.

               INT. DUDE'S BATHROOM

               A dripping noise.

               We see the Dude's toes, which protrude from the soapy water,
               splayed against the far side of the tub.

               The Dude sits in the bathtub, surrounded by lit candles.

               A joint in a roach clip in one hand.

               The Dude takes a hit from the joint.

               We hear the phone ringing in the other room.

               The camera cuts to a small table next to the tub which has
               more candles on it, a tape recorder and a tape case labeled,
               'Song of the Whale', which we hear in the background.

               After the Dude's outgoing message we hear:

                                   VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
                         Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer

                         Ahhhh...

                         Far fuckin' out.

                                   VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
                         You'll just need to present a claim-

               The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds, as of
               someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine.

               He looks blearily at the open doorway.

               A tall man dressed in black with a cricket paddle is smashing
               the answer machine.

                                   DUDE
                         Hey! Hey! This is a private
                         residence, man!

               A man holding a leash with a small animal on it skittering
               excitedly on the floor, has entered the bathroom and, two
               other men, including the one with the cricket bat are
               entering behind him.

               They turn on the light to the bathroom as the enter.

               The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Ah, nice marmot.

               The first man, with the leash, scoops up the marmot and
               tosses it, screaming, into the bathtub.

               The Dude screams.

               The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a
               frenzy of fearful aggression.

                                   ULI
                         Ver is za money Lebowski. Vee vant
                         zat money, Lebowski.

               The Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to
               hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on his
               shoulder and squishes him back into the water. The Dude hits
               at the marmot splashing water everywhere. The first man then
               scoops the marmot out of the water. It shakes itself off,
               spraying the Dude.

                                   SECOND MAN
                         You sink veer kidding und making

                         Vee could do things you only
                         dreamed of, Lebowski.

               The marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking
               itself and convulsing in little sneezes.

                                   SECOND MAN
                         Ja, vee belief in nossing.

                                   ULI
                         I SAY VEE CUT OFF YOUR CHONSON!

                                   SECOND MAN
                         Just sink about zat, Lebowski.

               The three men turn to leave. Over their retreating backs:

                                   ULI
                         Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

               The second man turns off the light as he leaves the room.

                                   SECOND MAN
                         Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und
                         skvush it, Lebowski!

               The man with the cricket bat smashes something made of glass
               on his way out of the bungalow.

               EXT. NORTH HOLLYWOOD AUTO CIRCUS - DAY

                                   POLICEMAN
                         It was discovered last night in Van
                         Nuys, uh lodged against an
                         abutment.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh man, lodged where!!

               A policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a
               large parking lot.

                                   POLICEMAN
                         You're lucky she didn't get
                         chopped, Mr. Lebowski.

                                   DUDE
                         Oohh Mannn!

                                   POLICEMAN
                         Must've been a joyride situation;
                         they abandoned the vehicle once
                         they hit the retaining wall.

               They have reached the Dude's car. The driver's side exterior
               has been scraped raw. The Dude looks in the window.

                                   DUDE
                         Oooh my fucking briefcase man! It's
                         not here! Shit!

                                   POLICEMAN
                         Yeah I saw that on the report.
                         Sorry uh, you gotta get in on the
                         other side. Uh, the side view was
                         found on the road by the car.

               The policeman hands the Dude an exterior rear-view mirror.

                                   POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                         You're lucky they left the tape
                         deck though, and the Creedence.

               The Dude climbs in the passenger side.

                                   DUDE
                         Awh! Jesus--what's that smell, man?

                                   POLICEMAN
                         Uh, yeah. Its ah, probably a
                         vagrant, slept in the car. Or maybe
                         just used it as a toilet, and moved
                         on.

               The Dude bellows through the glass on the driver's side:

                                   DUDE
                         Hey man, are you gonna find these
                         guys? Or, you know uh, I mean, do
                         you got any promising uh, uh,
                         leads? Or--

                                   POLICEMAN
                         Leads, yeah sure. I'll uh, just
                         check with the boys down at the
                         Crime Lab. They uh, got uh, four
                         more detectives working on the
                         case. They've got us working in
                         shifts.

               The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman
               rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by
               the glass.

                                   POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                         Leads!

               The policeman laughs hysterically.

                                   POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                         Wooo...Leads!

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY BAR

               The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a
               White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny with a soda.

                                   DUDE
                         My only hope is that the Big
                         Lebowski kills me before the
                         Germans can cut my dick off.

                                   WALTER
                         Now that is just ridiculous, Dude.
                         No one's going to cut your dick
                         off.

                                   DUDE
                         Thank you Walter.

                                   WALTER
                         Not if I have anything to say about
                         it.

                                   DUDE
                             (bitterly)
                         Thank you Walter. That makes me
                         feel very secure.

                                   WALTER
                         Dude--

                                   DUDE
                         That makes me feel warm inside.

                                   WALTER
                         Now Dude--

                                   DUDE
                         This whole fucking thing--I could
                         be sitting here with just pee
                         stains on my rug.

               Walter shakes his head.

                                   WALTER
                         Yeah.

                                   DUDE
                         But no man, I gotta--you know.

                                   WALTER
                         Fucking Germans. Nothing changes.
                         Fucking Nazis.

                                   DONNY
                         They were Nazis, Dude?

                                   WALTER
                         Come on, Donny, they were
                         threatening castration!

                                   DONNY
                         Uh-huh.

                                   WALTER
                         Are we gonna split hairs here?

                                   DONNY
                         No--

                                   WALTER
                         Am I wrong?

                                   DONNY
                         Well--

                                   DUDE (SOFTLY)
                         Look man...

                                   WALTER
                         Am I--

                                   DUDE
                         Man. They were nihilists, man.

                                   WALTER
                         Huh?

                                   DUDE
                         They kept saying they believe in
                         nothing.

                                   WALTER
                         Nihilists! Fuck me.

               Walter looks haunted.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         I mean say what you want about the
                         tenets of National Socialism, Dude,
                         at least it's an ethos.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah.

                                   WALTER
                         And let's also not forget--let's
                         not forget, Dude--that keeping
                         wildlife, uh, an amphibious rodent,
                         for uh, you know, domestic, within
                         the city-- that ain't legal either.

                                   DUDE
                         What're you, a fucking park ranger
                         now?

                                   WALTER
                         No, I'm just trying to uh--

                                   DUDE
                         Who gives a shit about the fucking
                         marmot!

                                   WALTER
                         --We're sympathizing here, Dude--

                                   DUDE
                         Fuck sympathy! I don't need your
                         fucking sympathy, man, I need my
                         fucking Johnson!

                                   DONNY
                         What do you need that for, Dude?

                                   WALTER
                         You gotta buck up, man, you cannot
                         drag this negative energy into the
                         tournament.

                                   DUDE
                         Fuck the tournament! Fuck you,
                         Walter!

               There is a moment of stunned silence.

                                   WALTER
                         Fuck the tournament?!

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Okay Dude. I can see you don't want
                         to be cheered up here. C'mon Donny,
                         let's go get us a lane.

               They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar. As he stares
               DOWN INTO HIS EMPTY GLASS:

                                   DUDE
                         Another Caucasian, Gary.

                                   GARY
                         Right, Dude.

               STILL STARING DOWN AT THE BAR:

                                   DUDE
                         Friends like these, huh Gary.

                                   GARY
                         That's right, Dude.

               The song, "Tumbling Tumbleweeds." starts playing signaling an
               'atmosphere' change. The bowling alley is a distant sound.

               Gary sits the Dude's drink in front of him and the camera
               pans out to show a middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome-
               Sam Elliot, perhaps. He has a large Western-style mustache
               and wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat. And he is
               seated on the stool that Walter vacated.

               TO THE BARTENDER:

                                   THE STRANGER
                         D'ya got a good sarsaparilla?

               We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened
               the movie.

                                   GARY
                         Sioux City Sarsaparilla.

               The Stranger nods.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         Yeah, that's a good one.

               Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar. His
               crinkled eyes settle on the Dude.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         How ya doin' there, Dude?

               The Dude looks over at the Stranger.

                                   DUDE
                         Not too good, man.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         One a those days, huh.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeap.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once
                         said, sometimes you eat the bar
                         en...

               The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the
               bar in front of The Stranger.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         Much abliged.

               He looks back at the Dude.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         ... and sometimes the bar, wal, he
                         eats you.

                                   DUDE
                         Hmm. That some kind of Eastern
                         thing?

                                   THE STRANGER
                         Far from it.

               The Stranger reaches for his drink and pauses before
               drinking.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         I like your style, Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Well I dig your style too, man. Got
                         a whole cowboy thing goin'.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         Thankie, there's just one thing,
                         Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Whassat?

                                   THE STRANGER
                         D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?

               THE DUDE LOOKS UP, ABSENTLY:

                                   DUDE
                         What the fuck are you talking
                         about?

               The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the
               bar.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         Okay Dude, have it your way.

               He stands up from the bar stool and looks at the Dude.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         Take 'er easy, Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah. Thanks man.

               He is gone. "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" is ending as Gray places
               the phone in front of the Dude:

                                   GARY
                         Call for ya, Dude.

               The Dude picks up the phone that Gary just put in front of
               him.

                                   DUDE
                         Hello.

                                   MAUDE
                         Jeffrey, you have not gone to the
                         doctor.

                                   DUDE
                         Uh, oh yeah, no no, I haven't yet,
                         Uh--

                                   MAUDE
                         I'd like to see you immediately.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh?

               INT. MAUDE'S LOFT

               We see a thin man dressed in black, with close cropped hair,
               sitting in a black leather chair, reading a magazine.

               He looks up at the Dude as he walks in the room.

                                   KNOX HARRINGTON
                         So you're Lebowski?

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah.

                                   KNOX HARRINGTON
                         Maudie's told me all about you.
                         She'll be back in a minute, sit
                         down. Do you want a drink?

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, sure, White Russian.

               The Dude sits down in the other leather chair.

                                   KNOX HARRINGTON
                         The bar's over there.

               The Dude gets up to go over to the bar.

                                   KNOX HARRINGTON (CONT'D)
                         So what do you do Lebowski?

                                   DUDE
                         Who the fuck are you man?

                                   KNOX HARRINGTON (SNICKERING)
                         Just a friend of Maudie's.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah? The friend with the cleft
                         asshole?

               The man snickers and laughs again.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Whadda you do?

                                   KNOX HARRINGTON (GIGGLES AND SNICKERS)
                         Oh, nothing much.

               Maude enters the room wearing a green outer garment.

                                   MAUDE
                         Hello Jeffery.

                                   KNOX HARRINGTON (TO MAUDE)
                         Hello.

                                   DUDE
                         Uh, yeah. How are you? Uh, listen
                         Maude, I've got to uh-- tender my
                         resignation or whatever, because
                         uh, looks like your mother really
                         was kidnapped after all.

                                   MAUDE
                         She most certainly was not!

                                   DUDE
                         Hey man, why don't you fucking
                         listen occasionally? You might
                         learn something. Now I got--

                                   MAUDE
                         And please don't call her my
                         mother.

               The man in the chair starts giggling.

                                   MAUDE (CONT'D)
                         She is most definitely the
                         perpetrator and not the victim.

                                   DUDE
                         I'm telling you, I got pretty
                         definitive evidence--

                                   MAUDE
                         From who?

                                   DUDE
                         From the main guy, Uli.

                                   MAUDE
                         Uli Kunkel? Her "co-star" in the
                         beaver picture?

                                   DUDE
                         Beav-? You mean vagina?--I mean,
                         you know the guy?

                                   MAUDE
                         I might have introduced them for
                         all I know.

               Maude walks past the man in the chair on her way to the
               counter.

                                   MAUDE (CONT'D)
                         Do you remember Uli?

                                   KNOX HARRINGTON
                         umm.

                                   MAUDE
                         He's a musician, he used to have a
                         group, 'Autoban'. Look in my LPs
                         they released one album in the late
                         seventies.

               The Dude fingers through the albums filling a metal rack.

                                   MAUDE (CONT'D)
                         Their music is a sort of--ugh-
                         techno-pop..

               The Dude stops between two albums.

               The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve. On it is the
               group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a
               picture of three young Germans, their forheads looming below
               slicked back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany.
               They wear red shirts, red lipstick, black ties and black
               pants.

               A bed of nails is the only set dressing on the cover.

                                   MAUDE (CONT'D)
                         So he's pretending to be the
                         abductor?

                                   DUDE
                         Well...yeah--

                                   MAUDE
                         Look, Jeffrey, you don't really
                         kidnap someone you're acquainted
                         with. The whole idea is that the
                         hostage can't be able to identify
                         you, after you've let them go.

                                   DUDE
                         Well I, I I know that.

               The man in the black chair giggles hysterically.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         What the fuck is with this guy? Who
                         is he?

                                   MAUDE
                         Knox Harrington, the video artist.

               The man continues to giggle and snicker.

                                   MAUDE (CONT'D)
                         So Uli has the money?

                                   DUDE
                         Well uh, no, not exactly. Uh, uh
                         uh, This is a very complicated
                         case, Maude. You know a Lotta ins,
                         a Lotta outs, a lotta what-have
                         yous. And uh, lotta strands to keep
                         in my head, man. Lotta strands in
                         old Duder's head.

               The phone rings. Knox Harrington motions to Maude for
               permission to answer it. He picks up the phone.

                                   KNOX HARRINGTON
                         Hello.

                                   MAUDE
                         Well if Uli doesn't have it, then
                         who does?

                                   KNOX HARRINGTON (LAUGHING)
                         It's Sandro about Biennale.

                                   MAUDE
                         Uh, look, I have to take this

                                   MAUDE (CONT'D)
                         Do you still have that doctor's
                         number?

                                   DUDE
                         Huh? No, really, it's not even, not
                         even bruised anymore

               Maude holds up another phone in her hand.

                                   MAUDE
                         Oh please Jeffrey. I don't want to
                         be responsible for any delayed
                         after-effects.

               She pushes a button on the phone.

               Knox laughs in the background.

                                   MAUDE (CONT'D)
                         Di a me Sandro. Si.

               (Sandro) is heard on the phone. He says: Come stai,
               carissima? (How are you, dearest?)

                                   DUDE
                         After effects?

                                   MAUDE
                         Si. Si! Che ridiculo.

               Both Knox, who has been listening to the phone conversation,
               and Maude, break into hysterical laughter.

               The Dude stands there looking bewildered.

               INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE

               CLOSE SHOT - THE DUDE

               His eyes are closed, a headset on, leaking tinnily through
               the headset we hear the last bars of Elvis Costello's "My
               Mood Swings."

               Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his
               torso, a white-smocked figure. The figure comes up to the
               Dude and pull one arm of the headset away from the Dude's
               ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly. he
               pulls back the Dude's hair and checks his ear.

               The figure circles to one side, out of frame.

                                   DOCTOR
                         Could you slide your shorts down
                         Mr. Lebowski, please?

               The Dude's eyes open.

                                   DUDE
                         Hmm? No, no man, she, she hit me
                         right here.

                                   DOCTOR
                         I understand. Could you slide your
                         shorts down please?

               INT. DUDE'S CAR - DAY

               The Dude is driving home. A Creedence tape plays. The Dude
               sucks down a joint and a beer. He glances at the rear-view
               mirror-- and, noticing something, looks again.

               HIS POV -

               A Volkswagon bug follows, a lone fat man drives.

               THE DUDE -

               His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint
               between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it
               out the driver's window--except that the window is not open.

               The butt bounces off the glass and down into the Dude's lap,
               showering sparks.

               DUDE'S CROTCH -

               The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs.

               The Dude screams. He frantically tries to put it out with his
               right hand.

               Then he pours the beer into his crotch.

               THE STREET -

               The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off
               to, make way, horns blaring. The car finally swerves left and
               smashes into a green dumpster that was sitting on the street,
               knocking it over.

               INSIDE THE CAR -

               The Dude sits stunned, his sun glasses are askew on his nose.

               The Dude grabs at his door, which won't open, and then slides
               over.

               He sits on the passenger side now, away from the lit butt.

               He looks around for it.

               Then he looks out both sides of the car for the blue
               Volkswagon that has disappeared. He looks back at the seat.
               There is a piece of paper sticking out from between the
               cushions.

               The Dude pulls it out.

               It is lined notebook paper, severely wrinkled and dripping
               beer, and covered with handwriting. The theme is titled "The
               Louisiana Purchase." In red ink is a large 'circled D', right
               of that is, 'Mrs. Jamtoss, History, period 4'. To the left of
               the circled D is the name 'Larry Sellers'. Some handwritten
               marginal comments and misspelled words are circled in red
               throughout.

               INT. CRANE JACKSON'S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER

               We are in front of the Dude and Donny, facing the stage where
               Marty, the Dude's balding landlord, performs a dance moderne.
               Walter enters from the side and sits two seats down from the
               Dude.

               As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice
               hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse
               audience.

                                   WALTER
                         He lives in North Hollywood on
                         Radford, near the In-and-Out
                         Burger.

                                   DUDE
                         Uh, the In-and-Out Burger's on
                         Camrose.

                                   WALTER
                         Near the In-and-Out Burger. Th--

                                   DONNY
                         Those are good burgers, Walter.

                                   WALTER
                         Shut the fuck up, Donny. The kid is
                         in ninth grade, Dude, and his
                         father is--are you ready for this?--

                                   DUDE
                         Hmm.

                                   WALTER
                         His father is, Arthur Digby
                         Sellers.

                                   DUDE
                         Who the fuck is that?

                                   WALTER
                         Huh?

                                   DUDE
                         Who the fuck is Arthur Digby
                         Sellers?

                                   WALTER
                         Who the fu-- have you ever heard of
                         a little show called Branded, Dude?

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah. Yes I know--

                                   WALTER
                         All but one man died? There at
                         Bitter Creek?

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, I know the fucking show
                         Walter, so what?

                                   WALTER
                         Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote
                         156 episodes, Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Huh!

                                   WALTER
                         Bulk of the series.

                                   DUDE
                         Ahwww.

                                   WALTER
                         Not exactly a lightweight.

                                   DUDE
                         No.

                                   WALTER
                         And yet his son is a fucking dunce.

                                   DUDE
                         Uh.

                                   WALTER
                         Anyway uh, we'll go there after the
                         uh...

               He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         ...what have you. We'll, brace the
                         kid, should be a push over--

                                   DONNY
                         We'll be near the In-and-Out
                         Burger.

                                   WALTER
                         SHUT THE FUCK UP, Donny. We'll, go
                         out there and we'll brace the kid-
                         he should be a pushover. We'll get
                         that fucking million dollars back,
                         if he hasn't spent it already. A
                         million fucking clams. And yes,
                         we'll be near the, uh--

                                   DONNY
                         In-n-Out.

               The Dude looks over at Walter and points to the stage.

                                   DUDE (SOFTLY)
                         Hey, shussh shussh, man.

                                   WALTER
                         ...some burgers, some beers, a few
                         laughs. Our fucking troubles are
                         over, Dude.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL AREA - NIGHT

               The Dude's car chugs to a stop on a residential street.

                                   DUDE
                         Awwww fuck me, man! That kid's
                         already spent all the money man!

               Parked incongruously in front of the small white house is a
               brand new red Corvette.

                                   WALTER
                         New 'vette? Hardly Dude, I'd say he
                         still has, 960 to 970 thousand
                         dollars left, depending on the
                         options. Wait in the car, Donny.

               THE FRONT DOOR -

               Walter knocks on the door. It is opened by a matronly Spanish
               woman.

                                   PILAR
                         Jace?

                                   WALTER
                         Pilar? My name is Walter Sobchak,
                         this is my associate Jeffrey
                         Lebowski. Uh, we came to talk about
                         little Larry. May we come in?

                                   PILAR
                         Jace jace.

                                   WALTER (SOFTLY)
                         Thank you.

               INT. SELLERS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               They enter a living room and stand, looking about. There is a
               rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and nudges the
               Dude.

                                   WALTER
                         That's him, Dude.

               At the other end of the living room a man lies on something
               that looks like a hospital gurney with its midsection
               enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble.

               It is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct
               hisses in and out.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                             (VIVA VOCE)
                         AND A GOOD DAY TO YOU, SIR.

                                   PILAR
                         Ay, see down, please.

               CALLS UP THE STAIRS:

                                   PILAR (CONT'D)
                         Larry! Sweetie! Dat mang is here!

               He and the Dude sit on a plastic protected sofa. In a lowered
               voice, to Pilar:

                                   WALTER
                         Is he, . . . Does he still write?

                                   PILAR
                         Oh no, no. He has healt' problems.

                                   WALTER
                         Uh-huh.

               HE BELLOWS ACROSS THE ROOM:

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Uh sir, I just want to say, uh,
                         that we're both--on a personal
                         level, really enormous fans.
                         Branded, especially the early
                         episodes, was truly a source of
                         inspiration.

               LARRY, a fifteen-year-old, enters the room and looks at the
               two men.

                                   PILAR
                         Sweetie see down. This man is the
                         police.

                                   WALTER
                         Oh no ma'am, We didn't want to give
                         the impression that we were police
                         exactly. We're hoping it won't be
                         necessary to call the police. But
                         that's up to little Larry here.
                         Isn't it, Larry?

               Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out the
               homework, which is now in a ziploc bag. He holds it out at
               arm's length, displaying it to Larry.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Is this your homework, Larry?

               Larry does not respond.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Is this your homework, Larry?

                                   DUDE
                         Look, man, is--

                                   WALTER
                         Dude, please!. . .

                                   DUDE
                         Uooh.

                                   WALTER
                         Is this your homework, Larry?

                                   DUDE
                         Just ask him about the car, man.

               Walter still holds out the homework.

                                   WALTER
                         Is this yours, Larry? Is this your
                         homework, Larry?

                                   DUDE
                         Is that your car out front?

                                   WALTER
                         Is this your homework, Larry?

                                   DUDE
                         We know it's his fucking homework!
                         Where's the fucking money, you
                         little brat?!

               Throughout, Walter stares at Larry with the homework extended
               towards him.

                                   WALTER
                         Look, Larry. . . Have you ever
                         heard of Vietnam?

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

                                   WALTER
                         You're entering a world of pain,
                         son. We know that this is your
                         homework. We know you stole a car--

                                   DUDE
                         And the fucking money!

                                   WALTER
                         And the fucking money. And we know
                         that this is your homework.

                                   DUDE
                         We're gonna cut your dick off
                         Larry.

                                   WALTER
                         You're KILLING your FATHER, Larry!.

               No answer.

               FINALLY, IN DISGUST:

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Alright, this is pointless.

               As he shoves the homework back in the attache case:

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Ok, time for Plan B. You might want
                         to watch out that front window
                         Larry.

               He heads for the door.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Son, this is what happens when you
                         FUCK a STRANGER in the ASS.

               EXT. SELLERS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               Walter strides down the lawn with his attache case like an
               enraged encyclopedia salesman. Without looking back at, the
               Dude, who follows:

                                   WALTER
                         Fucking language problem here.
                         Little prick is stonewallin' me.

               The Dude comes out of the house.

                                   DUDE
                         Walter, what are you doing man?

               Walter pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and
               takes out a crowbar.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         What are you doing?

                                   WALTER
                         Here you go Larry.

               He walks over to the Corvette.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, YOU SEE WHAT
                         HAPPENS LARRY!

               CRASH! He swings the crowbar into the back window,
               whichshatters.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, great.

                                   WALTER
                         THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK
                         A STRANGER IN THE ASS LARRY!

               CRASH! He takes out the driver's window.

               Larry watches out the front window. A light comes on in the
               house across the street. Dogs bark.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS LARRY.

               Walter reaches in the car and turns on the headlights.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS LARRY? YOU SEE
                         WHAT HAPPENS! WHEN YOU FUCK A
                         STRANGER IN THE ASS!

               CRASH! Walter smashes the windshield continually. Lights are
               going on in houses down the street. Distant dogs bark.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS,

               CRASH!

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS LARRY?

               CRASH!

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS LARRY?

               CRASH!

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS LARRY WHEN YOU
                         FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS?

               Walter moves to the front of the car and smashes a headlamp.

               CRASH!

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS LARRY!

               CRASH! The other headlamp gets hit.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS LARRY!

               Walter now smashes in the hood.

                                   MAN
                         MY CAR!

                                   WALTER
                         THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS LARRY!

                                   MAN
                         MY BABY, STOP IT!

                                   WALTER
                         THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK
                         A STRANGER--

               A man in a open shirt with an under shirt and boxer shorts
               has run over behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a
               backswing of the crowbar.

                                   MAN
                         WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!
                         STOP IT!

               He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter.

                                   WALTER
                         Oh hey, hey man.

                                   MAN

                         WEEK!

                                   WALTER
                         Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

                                   MAN

                                   WALTER
                         Hey, I'm sorry.

               Walter cringes before the enraged Mexican.

               The man looks about wildly.

                                   MAN
                         I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS

                                   WALTER
                         Com'on man.

               The man looks over at the Dude's car.

                                   MAN
                         I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR MAN!

               He runs over to the Dude's car.

                                   DUDE
                         Whoa..No! Hey! Hey! THAT'S NOT his-
                         HEY

               THUMP! CRASH! the man hits the Dude's trunk and back window
               with the crowbar.

                                   MAN
                         FUCK JOO AHHGGG, GOD DAMMIT FUCK

               CRASH!

                                   DUDE
                         Oh no, no man, no.

                                   MAN
                         YOU LIKE DAT, FUCK JOO!

               CRASH! The man smashes out the left rear window.

                                   DUDE
                         NO! no awwwww, noooo.

               CRASH! The man starts smashing the Dude's windshield.

                                   MAN
                         I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR MAN!

               CRASH!

                                   DUDE
                         Awwww. Heyyyy.

                                   MAN
                         I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

               ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO:

               INT. THE DUDE'S CAR - NIGHT

               We look into the car through the broken windshield as it
               rattles down the freeway. Wind whistles through the caved-in
               windows.

               The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the
               road. Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch
               on In-and-Out Burgers.

               Santana music plays above the bluster of wind.

               INT. DUDE'S BUNGALOW

               As the Dude talks on the phone he hammers a two-by-four into
               the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.

                                   DUDE
                         I accept your apology. . . No I
                         just, I just want to handle it by
                         myself from now on. No, no . . No!
                         That has nothing to do with it...

               He finishes hammering.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Yes, the car made it home, You're
                         calling at home. No, Walter, it did
                         not look like Larry was about to
                         crack. Well that's your perception.
                         You know Walter you're right, there
                         is an unspoken message here, it's
                         FUCK YOU, LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE.
                         . . Yeah, I'll be at practice.

               He hangs up and he rises and grabs a straight-backed chair
               that stands nearby. He has just finished sliding the chair
               into place with its top under the doorknob and its legs
               braced against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed,
               when the door opens--outwards. The chair clatters to the
               floor.

               Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in,
               moving the chair away.

                                   WOO
                         Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.
                         Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.

                                   BLOND MAN
                         Jackie Treehorn knows which
                         Lebowski you are, Lebowski.

                                   WOO
                         Jackie Treehorn wants to see the
                         deadbeat Lebowski.

                                   BLOND MAN
                         You're not dealing with morons
                         here.

               BLACKNESS

               Out of the blackness something falls toward us. It is a
               woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her mouth
               contorted by laughter. She is topless.

               She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a
               beat reappears, rising into the night sky.

               EXT. MALIBU BEACH - NIGHT

               A group of mostly tanned men, some with long hair, wearing
               tank tops, are blanket-tossing the laughing young woman in
               nightmarish slow motion.

               WIDER -

               It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing
               kerosene heaters.

               In long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears into
               darkness, descends into light, rises again.

               A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach
               light. He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing a cotton twill
               vanilla white, suit pants and jacket and what appears to be a
               long sleeved, red, silk shirt.

               Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and
               disappears.

                                   TREEHORN
                         Hello, Dude. Thanks for coming. I'm
                         Jackie Treehorn.

               INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

               The Dude looks around at the '60's modern decor.

                                   DUDE
                         Quite a pad you got here, man.
                         Completely unspoiled.

                                   TREEHORN
                         What's your drink, Dude?

                                   DUDE
                         White Russian, thanks.

                                   TREEHORN
                         White Russian.

                                   DUDE
                         How's the smut business, Jackie?

                                   TREEHORN
                         I wouldn't know, Dude. I deal in
                         publishing, entertainment,
                         political advocacy--

                                   DUDE
                         Which one's Logjammin'?

                                   TREEHORN
                         Yes regrettably, it's true,
                         standards have fallen in adult
                         entertainment. It's video, Dude.
                         Now that we're competing with the
                         amateurs, we can't afford to invest
                         in little extras like story,
                         production value, feelings.

               He hands him the drink.

               He taps his forehead with one finger.

                         On you, maybe.

                                   TREEHORN
                         Of course, you have to take the
                         good with the bad.

                         Hmmm. Well, I still jerk off
                         manually.

                                   TREEHORN
                         Ah heh, ha ha Of course you do.
                         Well, I can see you're anxious for
                         me to get to the point. Well, here
                         it is Dude. Where's Bunny?

                                   DUDE
                         Well I thought you might know that,
                         man.

                                   TREEHORN
                         Why would I? She only ran off to
                         get away from that rather sizable
                         debt to me.

                                   DUDE
                         Uuno, she didn't run off, she's
                         been uh--

               Treehorn waves this off.

                                   TREEHORN
                         I've heard the kidnapping story, so
                         save it. I know you're mixed up in
                         all this, Dude, and I don't care
                         what you're trying to get from the
                         husband. That's your business. All
                         I'm saying is, I want mine.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, right man, there are a lot of
                         uh, facets uh, to this. A lotta
                         interested parties uh--

               The phone rings.

                                   TREEHORN
                         Excuse me.

               Jackie answers the phone.

                                   TREEHORN (CONT'D)
                         Yeah, Oh yeah? Where's that?

               The Dude becomes very interested in watching Jackie scribble
               on a note pad.

                                   TREEHORN (CONT'D)
                         Alright.

               Jackie hangs up, pulls the top sheet off the note pad, and
               gets up, folds the paper, and turns toward the Dude.

                                   TREEHORN (CONT'D)
                         Excuse me.

               Jackie walks out of the room.

               The Dude leaps up and quickly walks over to check on Jackie's
               return. Then he grabs a pencil and hurriedly shades the
               etching left by the pen on the note pad, revealing a drawing
               of a man with a unusually large penis.

               The Dude is somewhat startled by what he sees.

                                   DUDE
                         Hummm!

               The Dude hears a door shut and he grabs the top sheet of the
               note pad and puts it in the pocket of his pants as he races
               back to the couch and re-positions him self as he was when
               Jackie left.

               Jackie enters the room.

                                   TREEHORN
                         Forgive me.

                                   DUDE
                         No problemo man... So uh, if I uh,
                         can find your money, ah, what's in
                         it for the Dude?

                                   TREEHORN
                         Well of course, there's that to
                         discuss. A Refill?

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, did the Pope shit in the
                         woods?

                                   TREEHORN
                         A 10% finder's fee? Is that
                         alright?

                                   DUDE
                         Uumm! Okay, done Jackie. Yeah, I
                         dig the way you do business man.
                         Your money is being held by a kid
                         named Larry Sellers. He lives in
                         North Hollywood, on Radford, Uh, by
                         the In-and-Out Burger.

               Jackie brings him the drink.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure
                         your goons can get it off uh, him I

                         . . . five grand.

               He getse to his feet, but sways woozily and he falls
               backward.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         I'll go out and mingle.--Ahem um,
                         you mix a hell of a Caucasian,
                         Jackie.

               The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus and he has to sit
               back down.

                                   TREEHORN
                         A fifteen-year-old? Is this some
                         sort of a joke?

               Words echo and Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.

               He is joined on either side by Woo and the blond man, all
               three men looking grimly down at the Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         Awww, no joke. No funny stuff,
                         Jackie . . . the kid's got it. Hi,
                         fellas . . . kid just wanted a car.

               The Dude drops his drink to the carpet.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         All the Dude ever wanted . . . was
                         his rug back . . . not greedy . . .
                         it really...

               He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         ...tied the room together.

               FROM UNDER THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE -

               Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and
               squishes.

                                                       FAST FADE OUT:

               BLACK

                                   THE STRANGER
                         Darkness warshed over the Dude--
                         darker'n a black steer's tookus on
                         a moonless prairie night. There was
                         no bottom.

               We hear a thundering bass.

               ANOTHER TITLE CARD:

                                         THE DUDE

                                      MAUDE LEBOWSKI

               THIRD TITLE CARD:

                                      IN GUTTERBALLS

               The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked
               by a pair of bowling balls. The bending bass sound turns into
               the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's "Just
               Dropped In."

               The Dude walks down a long corridor dressed as a cable
               repairman. He performs Marty's 'cycle' as he walks.

               The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light as the
               corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley.

               He gazes up at a 'eight mile high' rack of bowling shoes.

               At the top is a large full moon which is the source of the
               light.

               Behind the counter is a man that seems to be Saddam Hussain.
               Saddam pulls a pair of silver and gold bowling shoes from the
               rack and hands them to the Dude.

               The Dude now dances down a long flight of stairs that seem to
               stretch out to a starry infinity. They go down to the center
               of a circular platform that contains 32 dancers and a bowling
               lane on the other side of the platform that stretches out
               into the starry void.

               The dancers have '3D' cut outs of bowling pins on their
               heads. They dance around a central figure, Maude. Maude wears
               a bowling ball breasted, armored breastplate and Norse
               headgear, has braided pigtails, and holds a trident.

               The Dude continues to dance down the stairs toward the
               platform, which is the same black and white tile as the
               stairs.

               He holds a black and red swirled bowling ball high over his
               head. He slowly approaches Maude from behind. The Dude stands
               behind her and, pressed up against her, helps her with her
               follow-through as she releases the bowling ball.

               The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini
               skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs
               turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the
               end.

               But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their legs
               -it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane.

               He is face down, his arms, torpedo-like, pressed against his
               sides.

               His point-of-view shows the lane rushing by below, the little
               ball-guide arrows zipping by.

               The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so
               that he now glides along the lane face-up.

               Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing
               chorines.

               The Dude smiles dreamily and does another barrel-roll so that
               he is once again gliding face-down. He looks forward and his
               forward momentum blows back his hair.

               Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs,
               are the approaching pins. We hit the pins, scattering them,
               and rush on into black.

               A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a
               topless woman, squealing, her legs kicking.

               As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three men
               are entering from the background, emerging into a pool of
               light. It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding
               oversized shears which they menacingly scissor.

               The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the
               advancing Germans. He turns and runs, fists pumping.

               The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of
               car-bys. The field of black is punctured by headlights.

               The Dude runs blearily down the middle of the Pacific Coast
               Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring.

               With the siren squealing to a stop, a squad car with flashing
               gumballs pulls up.

               INT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

               The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the
               motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded:

                                   DUDE
                         He was innocent. Not a charge was
                         true. And they say he ran
                         awaaaaaay. BRANDED!

               INT. POLICE CHIEF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces
               off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing
               chair.

               His wallet is tossed onto the desk.

               The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through
               it with disgusted incredulity.

                                   CHIEF
                         Is this your only I.D.?

               He looks at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card.

                                   DUDE
                         I know my rights man.

               The Chief of police takes a piece of folded paper from the
               wallet and opens it up to find the 'drawing' and the word
               Treehorn on the top.

                                   CHIEF
                         You don't know shit, Lebowski.

                                   DUDE
                         I want a fucking lawyer, man. I
                         want Bill Kunstler, man...or umm,
                         or Ronald Kuby.

                                   CHIEF
                         Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had
                         to eject you from his garden party,
                         that you were drunk and abusive.

                                   DUDE
                         Mr. Treehorn, treats objects like,
                         women man.

                                   CHIEF
                         Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water
                         in this town, You don't draw shit
                         Lebowski. Now we got a nice quiet
                         little beach community here, and I
                         aim to keep it nice and quiet. So
                         let me make something plain. I
                         don't like you sucking around
                         bothering our citizens, Lebowski. I
                         don't like your jerk-off name, I
                         don't like your jerk-off face, I
                         don't like your jerk-off behavior,
                         and I don't like you, jerk-off. Do
                         I make myself clear?

               The Dude stares absently.

                                   DUDE
                         I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

               The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude. It
               hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee
               splashing everywhere.

               The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         --Ow! Fucking fascist!

               The Chief pushes the Dude and the chair backwards to the
               floor.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Awwwwwuh!

                                   CHIEF
                         STAY OUT OF MALIBU, LEBOWSKI!!

               He kicks the Dude.

                                   CHIEF (CONT'D)
                         STAY OUT OF MALIBU, DEADBEAT! Keep
                         your ugly fucking goldbricking ass
                         out of my beach community!

               INT. CAB - NIGHT

               The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab. He is gingerly
               touching at sore spots on his face and scalp.

               "Peaceful Easy Feeling" is on the radio.

              Dude's POV: The back of the driver, a large black man with a
              brimless, black leather cap on his head.

                                   DUDE
                         Jesus, man, can you change the
                         channel?

                                   DRIVER
                         Fuck you man! You don't like my
                         fucking music, get your own fucking
                         cab!

                                   DUDE
                         I've had a really ruff--

                                   DRIVER
                         I'll pull over the side and kick
                         your ass out!

                                   DUDE
                         Man, c'mon I had a rough night, and
                         I hate the fucking Eagles, man.

                                   DRIVER
                         Umm humm!

               EXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

               The cab screeches over towards the curb. Another car,
               oncoming, its horn blaring, speeds by.

               The driver stops the cab and gets out and opens the Dude's
               door and reaches in and pulls the Dude out of the cab.

                                   DRIVER
                         Outta my fucking cab!

                                   DUDE
                         Hey man!

                                   DRIVER
                         Out, get--

                                   DUDE
                         Man man! Hey!

               The cab driver gets back in the cab and screeches away.

               Coming up the road behind the Dude is a red convertible,
               which passes him quickly. The driver, singing loudly and
               badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a
               dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a
               kite, is Bunny Lebowski.

               THE FOOTWELL -

               When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the
               clutch, in an open-toed bright red sandal shoe, that has five
               green painted toes.

               On the accelerator her right foot has five more toes.

               INT. DUDE'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

               The Dude cautiously looks in the open front door. He goes in
               and looks around.

                                   DUDE
                         Awwwwh Jesus.

               The place is a wreck. Furniture has been overturned,
               upholstery slashed, drawers dumped.

               Quiet.

               He moves forward into the room and trips over the nailed 2x4.

               He turns and looks back at the 2x4.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Ummph.

               Maude emerges from the bedroom. She wears a bathrobe.

                                   MAUDE
                         Jeffrey.

                                   DUDE
                         Maude?

                                   MAUDE
                         Love me.

               She pulls open the bathrobe and lets it drop to the floor.

               The Dude is stupefied.

                                   DUDE
                         Uh, that's my robe.

                                                       WE CUT TO:

               BLACK -

               After a beat, a voice from the blackness:

                                   MAUDE
                         Tell me a about yourself, Jeffrey.

                                   DUDE
                         Well, not much to tell.

               A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude lights
               himself a 'roach', which he holds in a roach clip.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         I uh, I was, uh, one of the authors
                         of the Port Huron Statement.-- Uh
                         the original Port Huron Statement.

               The Dude and Maude lie next to each other in bed.

                                   MAUDE
                         Uh-huh.

                                   DUDE
                         Not the compromised second draft.

               The Dude tokes on the roach.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Uh, and then I, uh. . . ummm, ever
                         hear of the Seattle Seven?

                                   MAUDE
                         Mmnun.

                                   DUDE
                         That was me...and uh, uh, six other
                         guys. Uhh, And then uh . . . the
                         music business briefly.

                                   MAUDE
                         Oh?

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah. Roadie for Metallica.

                                   MAUDE
                         Oh.

                                   DUDE
                         Speed of Sound Tour.

                                   MAUDE
                         Mmm hmmm.

                                   DUDE
                         Bunch of assholes. And then, uh,
                         you know, a little of this, a
                         little of that.

               The Dude tokes the roach again.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Uh, my career's, slowed down a
                         little lately.

                                   MAUDE
                         What do you do for, for recreation?

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, the usual. Bowl. Drive around.
                         The occasional acid flashback.

               He sucks on the roach and he gets some burning ash in his
               throat.

               He coughs and climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it.

                                   MAUDE
                         What happened to your house?

               She wedges a pillow into the small of her back.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, Jackie Treehorn trashed the
                         place. He thought I had your
                         father's money, he got me out of
                         the way while he looked for it.
                         Cocktail?

                                   MAUDE
                         No thanks. It's not my father's
                         money, it's the Foundation's. Why
                         did he think you have it? And who
                         does?

               She clasps a hand on each kneecap, and pulls her knees in
               toward her chest to keep her pelvis raised.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, Larry Sellers, this high-school
                         kid. Real fucking brat.

               He mixes a White Russian at the bar in the living room.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Ya know, this is a very complicated
                         case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.
                         Uh, ya know. Fortunately I'm
                         adhering to a pretty strict, uh,
                         drug uh, regimen to keep my mind,
                         you know, uh limber ya know. I'm
                         very fucking close to your father's
                         money.

                                   MAUDE
                         I keep telling you, it's the
                         Foundation's money. Father doesn't
                         have any.

               The Dude re-enters the bedroom.

                                   DUDE
                         Ummph, Whadda you talking about?
                         He's fucking loaded.

                                   MAUDE
                         No no, the wealth was all Mother's.

                                   DUDE
                         Waa--he runs stuff, uh, you know--

                                   MAUDE
                         We did let him run one of the
                         companies, briefly, but he didn't
                         do very well at it.

                                   DUDE
                         Ah... he's uh, you know.

                                   MAUDE
                         No. He helps administer the
                         charities now, and I give him a
                         reasonable allowance. He has no
                         money of his own. I know how he
                         likes to present himself; Father's
                         weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.

                                   DUDE
                         Uh. Do you think he uh,--what is
                         that yoga?

               Throughout, Maude lays on her back with her knees pulled in
               and now she rolls back and forth on the bed.

                                   MAUDE
                         It increases the chances of
                         conception.

               The Dude spits some White Russian.

                                   DUDE
                         Increases?

                                   MAUDE
                         Well yes, what did you think this
                         was all about? Fun and games? I
                         want a child.

                                   DUDE
                         Okay, Yeah, okay but let me, let me
                         explain something about the Dude--

                                   MAUDE
                         Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a
                         partner. In fact I don't want the
                         father to be someone I have to see
                         socially, or who'll have any
                         interest in raising the child
                         himself.

               Something occurs to him.

                                   DUDE
                         So...that doctor uh.

                                   MAUDE
                         Exactly. Now what happened to your
                         face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that
                         as well?

               The Dude stares off into space, thinking. His answer is
               absent.

                                   DUDE
                         No, uhhh, It was the Chief of
                         police of Malibu. A real
                         reactionary . . . So your father .
                         . . Oh yeah, I get it! Yeah, Yeah!

                                   MAUDE
                         What?

                                   DUDE
                         Oh man, my thinking about this
                         case, had become very uptight.
                         Yeah. Your father--

               The Dude is leaves the bedroom.

               FROM THE BEDROOM -

                                   MAUDE
                         Jeffery! What're you talking about?

               LIVING ROOM -

               The Dude finishes punching a number into the phone.

                                   MAUDE
                         Jeffery!

               The phone rings on the other end.

                                   DUDE
                         Walter, if you're there, pick up

                         emergency...

                                   WALTER
                         Dude?

                                   DUDE
                         C'mon I'm not--

                                   WALTER
                         Dude?

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, listen Walter, I'm at my
                         place, I need you to come pick me

                                   WALTER
                         I can't drive, Dude, it's erev
                         shabbos.

                                   DUDE
                         What?

                                   WALTER
                         Erev shabbas.

                                   DUDE
                         What?!

                                   WALTER
                         Erev shabbos. I can't drive.

                                   DUDE
                         Man!

                                   WALTER
                         I'm not even supposed to pick up
                         the phone, unless it's an
                         emergency.

                                   DUDE
                         This IS a fucking emergency.

                                   WALTER
                         I understand. That's why I picked
                         up the phone.

                                   DUDE
                         WALTER, YOU FUCK, WE GOTTA GO TO
                         PASADENA, MAN! COME PICK ME UP OR
                         I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!

               EXT. DUDE'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

               THE DUDE -

               He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a sweatshirt. His
               attention is caught by something down the street.

               HIS POV -

               A car is parked halfway down the block. We can see the shape
               of a fat man in the driver's seat.

               THE DUDE -

               Strides purposefully down the street.

               HIS POV -

               The fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the car's
               ignition coughing, but the engine will not turn over.

                                   DUDE
                         Get out of that fucking car man.

               The man hurriedly fumbles in front of him. He brings up a
               newspaper, which he holds before his face.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Get out of that fucking car! Get
                         the fuck out of the car, man!

               THE DUDE -

               As he gets to the car He is revved with nervous energy.

               He tries to open the door but it is locked, so he reaches
               through the open driver's window to unlock it, but the man re
               locks it.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Get out of the fuckin--

               The man nervously complies. The Dude flinches at the man's
               movement as he gets out.

               The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch.

               He wears a cheap blue serge suit. He is bald with a short
               fringe and a mustache.

               The Dude shouts to cover his fear:

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Who the fuck are you, man!?

                                   DA FINO
                         Easy man, relax, man! No physical
                         harm intended!

                                   DUDE
                         Who the fuck are you?

                                   DA FINO
                         Okay man, I'm okay.

                                   DUDE
                         Why're you following me around?
                         Come on, fuckhead!

                                   DA FINO
                         Hey, relax man, I'm a brother
                         shamus.

               The Dude is stunned.

                         Brother Shamus? Like an Irish monk?

                         Hey hey, I'm not messing with your
                         special lady.

                                   DUDE
                         She's not my special lady, she's my

                         helping her conceive, man!

                                   DA FINO
                         Hey, man, I'm not--uh

                                   DUDE

                         Uh, Jackie Treehorn?

                                   DA FINO
                         The Knudsens.

                                   DUDE
                         The? Who who, who the fuck are the
                         Knudsens?

                                   DA FINO
                         The Knudsens. It's a wandering
                         daughter job. Bunny Lebowski, man.
                         Her real name is Fawn Knudsen. Her
                         parents want her back.

               He reaches into his inner suit coat pocket and pulls out two
               photos.

                                   DA FINO (CONT'D)
                         See?

               The Dude looks at the picture.

               It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but
               fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and
               straight Partridge Family hair and bangs.

                                   DUDE
                         Jesus fucking Christ.

                                   DA FINO
                         Crazy, huh? Ran away about a year
                         ago.

               He holds out another picture.

                                   DA FINO (CONT'D)
                         The Knudsens told me I should show
                         her this when I found her. It's the
                         family farm.

               A bleak farmhouse and and out buildings are the only features
               on a flat snow-swept landscape.

                                   DA FINO (CONT'D)
                         It's outside uhh Moorhead,
                         Minnesota. They think it'll make
                         her homesick.

                                   DUDE
                         Ssss Oh boy. How ya gonna keep 'em
                         down on the farm once they've seen
                         Karl Hungus.

               He hands back the picture.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.

                                   DA FINO
                         Oh man, that's terrible.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh I don't know, maybe not, but
                         she's definitely not around.

                                   DA FINO
                         Hey, uh, phfff, maybe you and me
                         could pool our resources--trade
                         information-- uh, professional
                         courtesy--

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah.

                                   DA FINO
                         Compeers, you know what I mean.

               We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an
               approaching van.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah yeah, I get it. Fuck off, Da
                         Fino. And stay away from my special
                         -- from my fucking lady friend man.

               The Dude steps out to meet Walter's van as it pulls up, its
               passenger window open and the Pomeranian leaning out and
               yapping.

               INT. STACKS OF PANCAKES HOUSE - NIGHT

               Four people sit at a booth: Uli and the second and third man.
               Also a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing
               jeans and a zebra striped sleeveless shirt. She is apparently
               braless, and is Teutonically pale on her face and arms. A
               waitress stands at the table with a pen and a check pad.

               The second man seems to be asleep. They look at menus.

               Uli looks sourly up and hands his menu to the waitress.

                                   ULI
                         Uhh the lingonberry pancakes.

                                   THIRD MAN
                         Aufwachen (Wake up) Arschloch
                         (asshole)!

                                   SECOND MAN
                         Lingonberry pancakes.

                                   THIRD MAN
                         Sree picks in blanket.

               The woman speaks to Uli in German.

                                   NIHILIST WOMAN
                         Fur (for) mich (me) auch (too)
                         Heidelberg Pfannkuchen (pancakes),
                         Uli, Heidelberg Pfann(f)kuchen.

                                   ULI
                         She has lingonberry pancakes.

                                   THIRD MAN
                         Oh, mann, wenn ich dann an die
                         Pfannkuchen in Bremen denke.
                         (Oh, man, that makes me think of
                         those pancakes in Bremen).

                                   SECOND MAN
                         Ja, ja, was ist damit?
                         (Yeah, yeah, what about it?).

                                   THIRD MAN
                         Es ware einfach besser (Wouldn't it
                         be better), den richtigen Butter
                          (to simply 
                         proper butter in it), die nicht so
                         wie eine Scheisse ist (the one
                         that's not so shitty). Es schmeckt
                         ganz so nach Kacke, mann! (This
                         really tastes like shit, man!).

                                   SECOND MAN
                         Ja, ja.
                         (Yeah, yeah).

               As the four talk in German.

               The camera stays with the girl and follows down her camera
               side leg, which ends in a bandage-swaddled foot.

               Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of the bandage.

               INT. WALTER'S VAN - SAME

               Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens to the Dude,
               while driving.

                                   DUDE
                         I mean we totally fucked it up,
                         man. We fucked up his pay-off. We
                         got the kidnappers all pissed off
                         at us, and Lebowski, he yelled at
                         me a lot, but he didn't do
                         anything. Huh?

               The dog barks in the back of the van.

                                   WALTER
                         Well, sometimes the cathartic,
                         uh...

                                   DUDE
                         No no, I'm saying if he knows I'm a
                         fuck-up, why does he leave me in
                         charge of getting his wife back?
                         Because he doesn't fucking want her
                         back, man! He's had enough!
                         He no longer digs her! It's all a
                         show! Okay? But then, why didn't he
                         give a shit about his million
                         bucks? I mean, he knows we never
                         handed off his briefcase, but he
                         never asked for it back. The
                         million bucks was never in the
                         briefcase. The briefcase was
                         fucking empty, man! The asshole was
                         hoping that they would kill her!
                         You threw out a ringer for a
                         ringer!

                                   WALTER
                         Huut! Okay, but how does all this
                         add up to an emergency?

                                   DUDE
                         Huh?

                                   WALTER
                         I'm saying, I see what you're
                         getting at, Dude, he kept the
                         money, my point is, huum, here we
                         are, it's shabbos, the sabbath,
                         which I'm allowed to break only if
                         it's a matter of life or death--

                                   DUDE
                         Will you come off it Walter. You're
                         not even fucking Jewish, man.

                                   WALTER
                         What the fuck are you talking
                         about?

                                   DUDE
                         Man, you're fucking Polish
                         Catholic.

                                   WALTER
                         What the fuck are you talking
                         about? I converted when I married
                         Cynthia!

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah.

                                   WALTER
                         Come on, Dude!

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, yeah yeah!

                                   WALTER
                         You know this!

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah, and five fucking years ago,
                         you were divorced.

                                   WALTER
                         So, what are you saying? When you
                         get divorced, you turn in your
                         library card? You get a new
                         license? You stop being Jewish?

                                   DUDE
                         This is the driveway.

               AS HE TURNS:

                                   WALTER
                         I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

                                   DUDE
                         Man, you know, it's it's all a part
                         of your sick Cynthia thing man.
                         Taking care of her fucking dog.
                         Going to her fucking synagogue.
                         You're living in the fucking past.

                                   WALTER
                         Three thousand years of beautiful
                         tradition, from Moses to Sandy
                         Koufax--YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I'M
                         LIVING IN THE FUCKING PAST! I-
                         Jesus. What the hell happened?

               He looks off as the van slows. The Dude looks where Walter is
               looking. They see a red sports car crashed into the fountain.

               EXT. THE LEBOWSKI MANSION - CONTINUOUS

               Walter's van pulls up the drive into the foreground and he
               and the Dude get out.

               Both gape off at the front lawn.

               Tire treads lead across the front lawn to where the little
               red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into the
               fountain.

                                   WALTER
                         Un huh, un huh, un huh, un huh.
                         What the fuck?

               INT. THE LEBOWSKI MANSION - CONTINUOUS

               The Dude, Walter and the dog enter the front door and descend
               the stairs into the 'great hall'.

                                   DUDE
                         AWWWWWH!

               TRACKING DOWN THE GREAT HALLWAY -

               Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and
               straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the
               length of the hall. Through the French doors at its far end
               we can see Bunny, naked, briefly bouncing past the windows.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Where was she man?

                                   BRANDT
                         Visiting friends of hers in Palm
                         Springs. She just picked up and
                         left, never bothered to tell us.

                                   DUDE
                         Well I guess the fucking nihilist
                         knew where she was!

                                   WALTER
                         Jesus, Dude! She never even
                         kidnapped herself.

                                   BRANDT
                         Who's this gentleman, Dude?

                                   WALTER
                         Who'm I?

               The Dude grabs Walters arm.

                                   DUDE
                         C'mon.

                                   WALTER
                         I'm a fucking veteran, that's who I
                         am!

               We watch the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to
               the great study. Walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its
               tail.

                                   BRANDT
                         You shouldn't go in there, Dude!
                         He's very angry!

               BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into--

               THE GREAT ROOM -

                                   DUDE
                         SO man!

               The Big Lebowski's wheelchair hums as he rolls toward them.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                             (bitterly)
                         So? She's back. No thanks to you.

                                   DUDE
                         Where's the fucking money,
                         Lebowski?

                                   WALTER
                         A MILLION BUCKS...

                                   DUDE

                         Who the hell is he?

                                   WALTER
                         Who am I, Who am I?

                         Walter...

                                   WALTER

                                   DUDE
                         Walter wait...

                                   WALTER

                         kidnapped and you were fucking glad

                                   WALTER
                         Look at that fucking phony, Dude!
                         Pretending to be a fucking
                         millionaire!

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Out of this house. Now you bums.

                                   WALTER
                         Let me tell you something else.
                         I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude,
                         and this guy is a fake. A fucking
                         goldbricker.

               He crosses to Lebowski.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Stay away from me, mister!

                                   WALTER
                         This guy fucking walks. I've never
                         been more certain of anything in my
                         life!

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         You stay away from me.

                                   DUDE
                         WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! HE'S A
                         CRIPPLE!

                                   WALTER
                         I've never been more certain of
                         anything in my life.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Stay away from me I said.

                                   WALTER
                         C'mon, c'mon.

               Walter reaches around and hoists the Big Lebowski out of the
               wheelchair by his armpits.

                                   LEBOWSKI
                         Get away from me!

                                   DUDE
                         WALTER!

                                   WALTER
                         Walk, you fucking phony!

               The Big Lebowski yells in horror and waggles helplessly, his
               rubbery feet grazing the floor like a Raggedy Ann's. The
               Pomeranian gaily leaps and yaps.

                                   DUDE
                         PUT HIM DOWN MAN!

                                   WALTER
                         Yeah, I'll put him down, Dude.
                         RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!

               He shoves the Big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the
               floor, weeping.

               The dog barks. It comes over to the Big Lebowski who flails
               about on the floor, and licks his face.

               The Big Lebowski pushes him away.

                                   DUDE
                         C'mon man, help me put him back in
                         his chair.

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY

               DONNY -

               Poised at the end of the lane, he approaches the line and
               releases a bowling ball. He watches the ball as it rolls and
               swerves into the pins. His face smiling the pins scattered
               but when the pins settle there is one pin left standing.
               Donny's expression changes. He stares at it in disbelief.

               In the background as a distant echo we hear Walter talking
               about Iraq.

               DUDE AND WALTER -

               Each with a beer at the scoring table.

                                   WALTER
                         Sure you'll see some tank battles.
                         But fighting in desert is very
                         different from fighting in canopy
                         jungle.

               Donny returns to a seat next to Walter. He still thinks about
               something and ignores Walter.

                                   DUDE
                         Umm humm.

                                   WALTER
                         I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's
                         war whereas, uh, this thing should
                         uh, you know, be a piece of cake. I
                         mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an
                         Abrams fucking tank. Me and
                         Charlie, eyeball to eyeball.

               The Dude applies a clear liquid on his finger tips using a
               cap brush.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah.

                                   WALTER
                         That's fuckin' combat. The man in
                         the black pyjamas, Dude. Worthy
                         fuckin' adversary.

                                   DONNY
                         Who's in pyjamas, Walter?

                                   WALTER
                         Shut the fuck up, Donny. Where as
                         what we have here, a bunch of fig
                         eaters, wearing towels on their
                         heads tryin' to find reverse on a
                         Soviet tank. This, this is not a
                         worthy fucking adversary.

                                   QUINTANA
                         HEY!

               The Dude and Walter look.

               Quintana bellows from the lip of the lane, and is restrained
               by O'Brien.

                                   QUINTANA
                         What's this "day of rest" shit?!
                         What's this bullshit, I don't
                         fucking care! It don't matter to
                         Jesus! But you're not fooling me
                         man! You might fool the fucks in
                         the league office, but you don't
                         fool Jesus! It's bush league psych
                         out stuff! Laughable, man! HA HA! I
                         would've fucked you in the ass
                         Saturday, I'll fuck you in the ass
                         next Wednesday instead! WHAOOOO!

               QUINTANA -

               He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O'Brien leads him
               away.

                                   QUINTANA (CONT'D)
                         You got a date Wednesday, baby!

               Walter, and the Dude watch him go. Walter turns and looks at
               the Dude.

                                   WALTER
                         He's cracking.

               EXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Donny, Walter and the Dude emerge from the alley, each
               holding his leatherette ball satchel.

                                   WALTER
                         The whole concept abates, I mean
                         many learned men have disputed
                         this, but in the 14th century the
                         Rambam he like...he....

               They react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming
               from a boom box.

               REVERSE -

               Uli and his two friends, in shiny black leather, stand in a
               line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot. Behind them
               orange flames lick gently in the Dude's car, which has been
               put to the torch. The orange flames glow on the men's
               creaking leather. Next to the car are three motorcycles,
               parked in a neat row. The Dude looks sadly at the burning
               car.

                                   DUDE
                         Well, they finally did it. They
                         killed my fucking car.

                                   ULI
                         Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

                                   SECOND MAN
                         Ja, uzzervize vee kill ze girl.

                                   THIRD MAN
                         Ja, it seems you forgot our little
                         deal, Lebowski.

                                   DUDE
                         You don't have the fucking girl,
                         dipshit. We know you never did.

               The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in
               German. Under his breath:

                                   DONNY
                         Are these the Nazis, Walter?

               Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three
               men:

                                   WALTER
                         No Donny, these men are nihilists,
                         there's nothing to be afraid of.

               The Germans stop conferring.

                                   ULI
                         Vee don't care. Vee still vant zat
                         money Lebowski or vee fuck you ups.

                                   WALTER
                         Fuck you. Fuck the three of you.

                                   DUDE
                         Hey, cool it Walter.

               Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans:

                                   WALTER
                         No, without a hostage there is no
                         ransom. That's what ransom is.
                         Those are the fucking rules.

                                   SECOND MAN
                         His girlfriend gafe up her toe!

                                   THIRD MAN
                         She sought we vould get a million
                         dollars!

                                   ULI
                         Iss not fair!

                                   WALTER
                         FAIR! WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST
                         AROUND HERE! YOU, BUNCH OF FUCKING
                         CRYBABIES?!

                                   DUDE
                         Hey, cool it Walter. Hey look, pal,
                         there never was any money. The Big
                         Lebowski gave me an empty
                         briefcase, so take it up with him
                         man.

                                   WALTER
                         And, I would like my undies back!

               Donny is visibly frightened.

                                   DONNY
                         Are these guys gonna hurt us,
                         Walter?

               WALTER'S TONE IS GENTLE:

                                   WALTER
                         No, Donny. These men are cowards.

               The Germans confer again, in German.

               THE CONFERENCE ENDS:

                                   ULI
                         Okay. So vee take ze money you haf

                                   WALTER
                         Fuck you.

                                   DUDE
                         Hey no, come on, Walter, come on,
                         we're ending this thing cheap man.

               The Dude digs into his pocket.

               Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Uli's.

                                   WALTER
                         No! What's mine is mine.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh, Come on, Walter!.

                                   ULI
                         No funny stuff

               He looks in his wallet:

                                   DUDE
                         Alright! Alright uh...

                                   ULI
                         No funny stuff!

                                   DUDE
                         I got uh, four bucks...

               He inspects the change in his palm.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         ...almost five!

                                   DONNY
                             (tremulously)
                         I got eighteen dollars, Dude.

                                   WALTER
                             (grimly)
                         What's mine is mine.

                                   ULI
                         VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN! VEE TAKES THE
                         MONEY!

                                   WALTER
                             (coolly)
                         Come and get it.

               With a ring of steel, Uli produces a glinting saber.

                                   ULI
                         VEE FUCK YOU UP!

                                   DUDE
                         Come on man.

                                   WALTER
                         Show me what you got. Nihilist.

                                   ULI
                         I FUCK YOU!

                                   DUDE
                         Walter, come on he's got a sword
                         thing man!

                                   WALTER
                         Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.

                                   ULI
                         I FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!

               WALTER -

               hurls his leather satchel.

               THE SECOND NIHILIST -

               Caught off-guard. The bowling ball thuds into his chest and
               buckles him over. He falls forward onto one hand, gasping.

               Uli charges at Walter with the saber.

                                   ULI (CONT'D)
                         I FUCK YOU, I PIG STICK--

               Uli cuts Walter's side with the sword and Walter makes him
               drop it.

               Walter twists away and grabs Uli's head in both hands; draws
               Uli's head up to his mouth, which closes on Uli's ear.

                                   WALTER
                         ARRGGG!

               The Dude confronts the other Nihilist but draws up short as
               he sends out karate kicks, The Nihilist gives a shout with
               each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his arms up, evading
               the kicks.

                                   THE THIRD MAN
                         I FUCK YOU!

                                   DUDE
                         Take it easy, man!

                                   THE THIRD MAN
                         I FUCK YOU!

                                   DUDE
                         Take the four dollars!

                                   THE THIRD MAN
                         I FUCK YOU! ... I FUCK YOU IN THE
                         ASS!

               WALTER -

               His jaw is still clamped on Uli's ear. Walter growls as Uli
               screams, he worries his ear, wagging his head.

               The second Nihilist crawls on his stomach gasping.

                                   DUDE
                         I'm gonna hit you with the fuckin'
                         ball man.

               He is awkwardly circling, evading the third Nilhilist's
               kicks, as he swings the ball bag.

               WALTER -

               Still worrying the ear. With a tearing sound his head and
               Uli's separate.

               ULI, EARLESS, SCREAMS.

               Walter spits his ear into the air, the camera follows it up.

                                   THE THIRD MAN (TO THE DUDE OFF CAMERA)
                         VEAKLING! I FUCK YOU!

               Walter draws back his fist.

                                   WALTER
                         ANTI-SEMITE!

               Bam!--A powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Uli
               for the count.

               The second Nihilist still pulls himself along on his stomach.

               DUDE AND THIRD NIHILIST -

               The Dude and the third Nihilist, both now panting heavily,
               have yet to establish body contact. The Nihilist continues to
               kick.

                                   THE THIRD MAN
                         I FUCK YOU IN THE ASS! I FUCK YOU
                         IN THE ASS!

               Finally he summons the nerve to charge the Dude, hands raised
               to deliver karate blows.

                                   THE THIRD MAN (CONT'D)
                         I FUCK YOU. I FUCK YOU. I FUCK YOU.
                         I FUCK--

               WHHAP--the boom box swings into frame to smash him in the
               face. Walter then bashes him in the back and he falls
               forward.

               All quiet.

               Walter, panting, looks around.

                                   WALTER
                         We've got a man down, Dude.

               He and the Dude run over to where Donny, lies gasping on the
               ground.

                                   DUDE
                         God! They shot him, man!

                                   WALTER
                         He's not shot. No Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         They shot Donny?

               Donny gasps for air.

                                   WALTER
                         There weren't any shots fired.

                                   DUDE
                         Huh?

                                   WALTER
                         It's a heart attack. Call the
                         medics, Dude. I'd go myself but I'm
                         pumping blood. Might pass out.

               The Dude runs into the lanes. Walter cradles Donny's
               shoulders with his right arm. He pats a reassuring left hand
               on Donny's chest and shoulder.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing
                         fine. We got help choppering in.

                                                       FADE OUT:

               HOLD IN BLACK

               INT. MORTUARY - DAY

               THE DUDE AND WALTER -

               They sit side by side. We hear footsteps coming up a
               cavernous stair well. Walter reads what appears to be a Bible
               that was on the mortuary Director's desk.

               The Dude sits very still, gazing up at a Psalm that is on a
               marble wall, in six inch gold letters, behind the desk. It
               reads:

               AS FOR MAN, HIS DAYS ARE AS GRASS, AS A FLOWER OF THE FIELD.
               SO HE FLORISHETH, FOR THE WIND PASSETH OVER IT AND IT IS
               GONE.

               PS 103.15

               A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.

                                   DONNELLY
                         Hello, gentlemen. You are the
                         bereaved?

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah man.

                                   DONNELLY
                         Francis Donnelly. Pleased to meet
                         you.

                                   DUDE
                         Jeff Lebowski.

                                   WALTER
                         Walter Sobchak.

                                   DUDE
                         The Dude, actually. It's uh...

                                   DONNELLY
                         Excuse me?

                                   DUDE
                         Aw, nothing.

                                   DONNELLY
                         Yes. I understand you're taking
                         away the remains.

                                   WALTER
                         Yeah.

                                   DONNELLY
                         We have the urn.

               He nods to his right.

                                   DONNELLY (CONT'D)
                         And I assume this is credit card?

               He vaguely hands a large leather folder across the desk to
               whomever wants to take it.

                                   WALTER
                         Yeah.

               He takes it, opens it, removes his glasses, and inspects the
               bill with his head pulled back for focus and cocked for
               concentration. Silence. The Dude smiles at Donnelly.

               Donnelly gives back a mortician's smile.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         UTHUMMm.

               At length Walter places the folder on the desk with bill
               facing Donnelly, pointing.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         What's this?

                                   DONNELLY
                         That's for the urn.

                                   WALTER
                         Don't need it. We're scattering the
                         ashes.

                                   DONNELLY
                         Yes, so we were informed. However,
                         we must of course transmit the
                         remains to you in a receptacle.

                                   WALTER
                         This is a hundred and eighty
                         dollars.

                                   DONNELLY
                         It is our most modestly priced
                         receptacle.

                                   DUDE
                         Uh, well can we just uh--

                                   WALTER
                         A hundred and eighty dollars?!

                                   DONNELLY
                         They range up to three thousand.

                                   WALTER
                         Uh, we're uh--Uhmm.

                                   DUDE
                         Can't, can't we just rent it from
                         you man?

                                   DONNELLY
                         Sir, this is a mortuary, not a
                         rental house.

                                   WALTER
                         We're scattering the fucking ashes!

                                   DUDE
                         Walter, Walter, Walter--

                                   WALTER
                         WHAT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED
                         DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!

               Walter hits the desk with his fist.

                                   DONNELLY
                         Sir, please lower your voices.

                                   DUDE
                         Man, don't you have, you know,
                         something uh, else we can put 'im
                         in? You know?

                                   DONNELLY
                         That is our most modestly priced
                         receptacle.

                                   WALTER
                         GODDAMNIT!! Is there a Ralph's
                         around here?

               EXT. POINT DUME - DAY

               It is a high, wind-swept bluff. Walter and the Dude walk
               towards the lip of the bluff.

               Walter carries a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic
               lid. When they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly for
               a beat. Finally:

                                   WALTER
                         Donny was a good bowler, and a good
                         man. He was . . . He was one of us.
                         He was a man who loved the
                         outdoors, and bowling, and as a
                         surfer he explored the beaches of
                         southern California...

               Walter extends his hand out palm up to point at the beach
               below.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         ...from La Jolla...

               Walter moves his hand to the north.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         ...to Leo Carillo and up to Pismo.
                         He died--he died as so many young
                         men of his generation, before his
                         time. In your wisdom Lord you took
                         him. As you took so many bright
                         flowering young men, at Khe San and
                         Lan Doc...

               The Dude shakes his head in disgust.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         ...and Hill 364. These young men
                         gave their lives. And so'd Donny.
                         Donny who loved bowling.

               Walter holds the Folger's coffee can up in both hands.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         And so, Theodore--Donald-
                         Karabotsos, in accordance with what
                         we think your dying wishes might
                         well have been, we commit your
                         final mortal remains to the bosom
                         of...

               Walter takes the can in his right hand and waves it at the
               ocean from left to right and back again.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         ...the Pacific Ocean, which you
                         loved so well.

               Walter peels the plastic lid off the coffee can.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Goodnight, sweet prince.

               AS HE SHAKES OUT THE ASHES:

               The wind has blown most of the ashes into the Dude, standing
               just to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands,
               frozen. Finished eulogizing, Walter looks down at his shirt
               and brushes some of the ashes off his shirt.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Shit.

               Walter turns around and sees the ashes all over the Dude.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Oh shit Dude, I'm sorry.

               He brushes off the Dude with his hands.

                                   WALTER (CONT'D)
                         Goddamn wind. Fuck.

               Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping
               Walter's hands away.

                                   DUDE
                         Goddamnit Walter! You fucking
                         asshole!

                                   WALTER
                         Shit! Dude, I'm sorry!

               The Dude gives Walter a furious shove.

                                   DUDE
                         Everything's a fucking travesty
                         with you man!

                                   WALTER
                         Look Dude, I'm sorry. It was an
                         accident!

                                   DUDE
                         What was zat-- What was that shit
                         about Vietnam!

                                   WALTER
                         Look Dude, I'm sorry--

                                   DUDE
                         What the fuck does anything have to
                         do with Vietnam! What the fuck are
                         you talking about?!

               Walter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost
               lost.

                                   WALTER
                         Dude, I'm sorry.

                                   DUDE
                         Fuckin'--

               He gives Walter a weaker shove. Walter seems dazed, then
               wraps his arms around the Dude.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Fuck, Walter.

                                   WALTER
                         Come on Dude. Hey fuck it man.
                         Let's go bowling.

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY

               We hear 'Send Me Dead Flowers' playing on the jukebox, as the
               camera focuses on a lane and as it follows a bowling ball
               down the lane into a strike. The view changes to back of the
               pin setter and the mechanics involved in resetting the pins.

               The far end of the bowling alley is closed and a man is
               cleaning one of the lanes. In the center, a lone bowler rolls
               a strike as The Dude walks up to the bar.

                                   DUDE
                         Two oat sodas, Gary.

                                   GARY
                         Right. Good luck tomorrow.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah. Thanks, man.

                                   GARY
                         Aw, sorry to hear about Donny.

                                   DUDE
                         Ah, yeah. Well, you know, sometimes
                         you eat the bar, and, sometimes uh,
                         you know...

               The Dude turns to his left and notices the 'Stranger' sitting
               at the bar.

                                   DUDE (CONT'D)
                         Hey man.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         Howdy do, Dude.

                                   DUDE
                         I wondered if I'd see you again.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         I wouldn't miss the semis.

                                   DUDE
                         Oh yeah?

                                   THE STRANGER
                         How things been goin'?

                                   DUDE
                         Ahh, you know. Strikes and gutters,
                         ups and downs.

               The bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter.

               The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         Sure, I gotcha.

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah. Thanks, Gary...Well take
                         care, man, gotta get back.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         Sure. Take it easy, Dude--

                                   DUDE
                         Oh yeah.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         I know that you will.

               THE DUDE, LEAVING, HOLDS UP HIS ARMS AND NODS:

                                   DUDE
                         Yeah. Well, the Dude abides.

                                   THE STRANGER
                         Heh heh.

               The Dude leaves and walks back to the lanes and holds up the
               beers.

                                   DUDE
                         Walter.

               Gazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words:

                                   THE STRANGER
                         The Dude abides...

               He gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into
               the camera.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         I don't know about you, but I take
                         comfort in that. It's good knowin'
                         he's out there, the Dude, takin'
                         her easy for all us sinners.
                         Shoosh. I sure hope he makes The
                         finals. Welp, that about does her,
                         wraps her all up. Things seem to've
                         worked out pretty good for the
                         Dude'n Walter, and it was a purt
                         good story, dontcha think? Made me
                         laugh to beat the band. Parts,
                         anyway. I didn't like seein' Donny
                         go. But then, I happen to know that
                         there's a little Lebowski on the
                         way. I guess that's the way the
                         whole durned human comedy keeps
                         perpetuatin' it-self, down through
                         the generations, westward the
                         wagons, across the sands a time
                         until we-- aw, look at me, I'm
                         ramblin' again. Wal, uh hope you
                         folks enjoyed yourselves.

               He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull
               back.

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         Catch ya later on down the trail.

               As we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar. As his
               voice fades:

                                   THE STRANGER (CONT'D)
                         ...Say friend, ya got any more of
                         that good sarsaparilla?...

               A lone bowler rolls a strike?

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.
